EDPB considers that, in most cases, it will not be possible for large online platforms to comply with the requirements for valid consent, if they confront users only with a choice between consenting to processing of personal data for behavioural advertising purposes and paying a fee. 
 
 When developing alternatives, large online platforms should consider providing individuals with an ‘equivalent alternative’ that does not entail the payment of a fee. #change 
 
 If controllers do opt to charge a fee for access to the ‘equivalent alternative’, they should give significant consideration to offering an additional alternative. This free alternative should be without behavioural advertising, e.g. with a **form of advertising involving the processing of less or no personal data**. Overall, it appears to me that EDPB has far exceeded it's competence here and is directly mandating product and business decisions (see the Free Alternative Without Behavioural Advertising option).
