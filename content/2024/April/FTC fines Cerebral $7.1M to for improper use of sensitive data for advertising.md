Cerebral provides online mental health and related services on a negative option basis, which means consumers are automatically charged unless they cancel those services. To get consumers to sign up for the company’s services and provide detailed personal data, the company claimed it offered “safe, secure, and discreet” services and that users’ data would be kept confidential, according to the complaint. The complaint charges that Cerebral failed to clearly disclose that it would be sharing consumers’ sensitive data with third parties for advertising and **buried disclaimers about its data sharing practices in dense privacy policies** #dark_pattern  . The complaint charges that Cerebral provided sensitive information of nearly 3.2 million consumers to third parties such as LinkedIn, Snapchat and TikTok. Cerebral gave third parties personal data about its users including names; medical and prescription histories; home and email addresses; phone numbers; birthdates; demographic information; IP addresses; pharmacy and health insurance information; and other health information, according to the complaint. #sensitive #adtech.

  - Require the company to implement a comprehensive privacy and data security program that, among other things, addresses the specific problems outlined in the complaint;
  - Require the company to post a notice on its website alerting users to the allegations outlined in the complaint and detail the steps it is required to take under the order;
  - Require the company to implement a data retention schedule and to delete most consumer data not used for treatment, payment, or health care operations unless consumers consent to its retention, and provide consumers with a clear mechanism to request that their data be deleted; and
  - Prohibit the company from misrepresenting any negative option and cancellation policies or practices and also require it to provide consumers with an easy method to cancel services.
