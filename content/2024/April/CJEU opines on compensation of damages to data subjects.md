 Even if the provision of the GDPR which has been infringed grants rights to natural persons, such an infringement cannot, in itself, constitute ‘non-material damage’ within the meaning of that regulation. Article 82(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that, in order to determine the amount of damages due as compensation for damage based on that provision, it is **not necessary**:
  - First, to apply mutatis mutandis the criteria for setting the amount of administrative fines laid down in Article 83 of that regulation. This is due to the fact that compensation under the relevant article does not have a punitive function; AND 
  - Second, to take account of the fact that several infringements of that regulation concerning the same processing operation affect the person seeking compensation . The fact that several infringements have been committed by the controller in relation to the same data subject cannot constitute a relevant criterion for the purposes of assessing the compensation to be awarded to that data subject under Article 82. Only the damage actually suffered by that person must be taken into consideration in order to determine the amount of the monetary compensation due by way of compensation.
