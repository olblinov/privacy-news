# Background

ND and DR both operate pharmacies. The appellant in the main proceedings, ND, also holds a mail-order licence and also sells his products, including pharmacy-only medicines, via Amazon Marketplace, an e-business platform whereby sellers may offer goods for sale directly to consumers. DR brought an action for an injunction to prevent ND from marketing pharmacy-only medicines on the Amazon online sales platform. According to DR, such marketing constitutes an unfair commercial act in so far as it has the consequence that ND infringes a legal provision, within the meaning of Paragraph 3a of the Law against unfair competition, namely, inter alia, Article 9 of the GDPR, which requires that the customer’s prior explicit consent be obtained for the processing of his or her data concerning health. 

# Are OTC sales health data?
- I would observe that, at first sight, it cannot be denied that the placing of an order for non-prescription medicines online assumes the processing of data from which certain information concerning health or, at least, certain indicia concerning health may be inferred, in so far as that order entails a link between the purchase of a medicine, a product relating to health par excellence and the identity of the purchaser. 
- The medicines in question, namely non-prescription medicines, are not as a rule intended for the treatment of a particular state, but may be used more generally to treat everyday diseases that may be encountered by anyone and are not symptomatic of a specific pathology or health status. Furthermore, those medicines are also frequently bought as a preventive measure so that they are available when required, or before leaving the habitual residence, for example. By way of illustration, an order for paracetamol does not allow any inference to be drawn as to the precise state of a person, as that molecule is indicated for the treatment of a variety of pains and fevers and is often among the medicines which people have at home, quite apart from any particular need.
- I am therefore of the view that the answer to the ... question should be that the data of the customers of a pharmacist which are transmitted when an order is placed on an online sales platform for pharmacy-only but non-prescription medicines do not constitute ‘data concerning health’ within the meaning of Article 4(15) and Article 9 of the GDPR, in so far as only hypothetical or imprecise conclusions as to the health status of the person placing the online order may be drawn, which it is for the referring court to verify. #change #personal_data
