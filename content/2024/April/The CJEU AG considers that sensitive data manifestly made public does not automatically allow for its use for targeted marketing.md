Mr. Maximilian Schrems, a Facebook user and activist, claims to have regularly received advertisements directed at homosexuals and invitations to corresponding events. The Advocate General takes the view that the fact that Mr Schrems has made a statement in full awareness concerning his own sexual orientation during a panel discussion open to the public may constitute an act by which he ‘manifestly made public’ those data within the meaning of the GDPR. He recalls that while data concerning sexual orientation fall into the category of data that enjoy particular protection and the processing of which is prohibited, that prohibition does not apply when the data are manifestly made public by the data subject. Nevertheless, this position does not in itself permit the processing of those data for the purposes of personalised advertising.
