International Card Services B.V. (ICS) were fined EUR 150k for a processing covering 1.5M people involving processing of customer name, address, telephone number, e-mail as well as a photo of the customer for bank ID purposes. The conducted DPIA does not provide a systematic description of the processing. Further is it has not appeared that the necessity and proportionality of the processing has been assessed, in particular the measures that contribute to the protection of the rights of data subjects. In addition, it has not emerged that interested parties, their representatives or the data protection officer are involved in the processing.
