The company had set a data retention period of ten years, after which user accounts were deactivated, but not deleted. Account data was therefore kept indefinitely. Google Analytics cookies were deposited on users' terminals without their consent. In addition, the company used a reCAPTCHA mechanism [[CNIL fines e-scooter company for collecting geotags, bad DPAs and lack of reCAPTCHA consent]], provided by GOOGLE, when creating an account and when connecting to the website and mobile application. This mechanism works by collecting hardware and software information (such as device and application data). While the data collected was transmitted to GOOGLE for analysis, the company did not provide any information to the user and did not obtain their prior consent #consent , either to access the information stored on their equipment or to write information on it. 
 
 I'm quite surprised that reCAPTCHA cookies require consent #cookies , given that their primary function is to prevent fraud, and are a valueable tool in fighting automated actions.  #change
