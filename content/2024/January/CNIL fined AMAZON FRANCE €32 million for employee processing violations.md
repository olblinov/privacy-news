This decision is quite similar to the German decision against H&M for privacy violations with respect to employees. Each warehouse employee is given a scanner to document the performance of certain tasks assigned to them in real time. Each scan carried out by employees results in recording of data, which is stored and used to calculate indicators providing information on the quality, productivity and periods of inactivity of each employee. CNIL ruled that (1) it was illegal to set up a system measuring work interruptions with such accuracy; and (2) it is excessive to keep all the data collected by the system, as well as the resulting statistical indicators for a period of 31 days.
