# Background
InMarket collects location information from a variety of sources, including its own apps and from third-party apps that incorporate its software development kit (SDK). InMarket cross-references consumers’ location histories with advertising-related points of interest to identify consumers who have visited those locations and then sorts consumers, based on their visits to these points of interest, into audience segments to which it can target advertising based on their past behavior. InMarket has maintained nearly 2,000 such audience segment lists that have included such categories as “parents of preschoolers,” “Christian church goers,” and “wealthy and not healthy.” #sensitive  #meta  #adtech  InMarket can display ads based on this information to users of apps that incorporate its SDK and also offers a product that sends ads to consumers based on their location. 

# Analysis

The company failed to tell third party apps that the location data provided through InMarket’s SDK will be combined with other data to create profiles of consumers, according to the complaint. 
- FTC says InMarket failed to obtain informed consent from users of its own apps, shopping rewards app CheckPoints and shopping list app ListEase. For example, when the company requests to use a consumer’s location data, it states that the data will be used for the app’s function, such as to provide shopping reward points or to remind consumers about items on their shopping list, and fails to inform users that the location data will also be combined with other data obtained about those users and used for targeted advertising.
- The FTC also says that the company’s policy of retaining geolocation data for five years was unnecessary to carry out the purposes for which it was collected and increased the risk that this sensitive data could be disclosed, misused, and linked back to the consumer, thereby exposing sensitive information about the consumer. 
- In addition to the ban on selling or licensing precise location data—a first for the FTC—the proposed order also requires InMarket to collect informed consent.
