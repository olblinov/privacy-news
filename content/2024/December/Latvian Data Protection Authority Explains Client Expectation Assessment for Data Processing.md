# Summary

The Latvian Data State Inspectorate (DVI) explains the importance of assessing client expectations regarding the processing of their personal data, which is crucial for ensuring the legality and transparency of data handling, and that fundamental client rights are not violated. This process involves evaluating client perspectives on data processing to align with data protection regulations. The DVI emphasizes that organizations must understand what clients reasonably expect regarding their data, considering factors such as the context of data collection, information accessibility, type of data, and practical situations. The goal is to ensure that data processing is transparent and that client expectations match how the organization uses the data.

# Details

## Background

- The DVI has published an article explaining the importance of client expectation assessments related to data processing.
- This assessment is essential for ensuring that data processing is lawful, transparent, and respects the fundamental rights of the client.
- The assessment helps in confirming that personal data is processed according to what clients reasonably expect.
- It also ensures that data processing is transparent and understandable for clients.

## Client Expectations

- Reasonable client expectations are what a client would naturally anticipate regarding their personal data processing, considering their relationship with the organization.
- These expectations are influenced by several factors:
    - **Context:** Why the client provided their data (e.g., for a contract, service, or marketing).
    - **Information Accessibility:** Whether the client is informed about the data processing and its purposes.
    - **Data Type:** More sensitive data (e.g., health information) lead to higher privacy expectations.
    - **Practical Situations:** How the organization uses the data (e.g., improving customer service, personalized offers).
- For example, a client providing their birthdate to receive birthday discounts expects that data to be used solely for that purpose.
- Similarly, a client whose phone calls are recorded for service quality expects to be informed about the recording and its intended use.
- If data is used for purposes beyond the client's reasonable expectations, even if legally justifiable, it may not be acceptable. For instance, using recorded calls for advertising purposes might not align with client expectations.

## Practical Approach

- Organizations can adopt objective or subjective approaches to assess client expectations.
    - **Objective approach** involves direct engagement with data subjects through methods such as:
        - **Surveys:** To gather clear data about client expectations, which can be conducted anonymously.
        - **Interviews and Focus Groups:** To gain deeper insights into client experiences and thoughts, such as their views on data sharing.
    - **Subjective approach** is based on the organization's experience using industry standards and past practices, for instance when developing a loyalty program.
- The DVI emphasizes that regardless of client expectations, organizations must choose an appropriate legal basis for data processing and comply with all data subject rights and data regulation requirements.
