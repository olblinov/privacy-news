# Summary

The French Data Protection Authority (CNIL) has issued formal notices to website publishers regarding the use of **dark patterns** in cookie consent banners. These patterns, designed to encourage users to accept cookies, often make it difficult to reject them. The CNIL's actions stem from numerous complaints and are based on the French Data Protection Act, its own guidelines, and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) recommendations. The core issue is that **rejecting cookies should be as easy as accepting them**, and any design that misleads users into consenting is considered a violation.

# Detail

## Factual Background

The CNIL is the French Data Protection Authority, responsible for ensuring compliance with data protection regulations. It investigates complaints and issues sanctions to organizations that violate these regulations. The CNIL has received many complaints about cookie consent banners that employ dark patterns to encourage users to accept cookies. These complaints led to investigations, which then resulted in formal orders for website publishers to modify their cookie banners to be compliant with the law. The CNIL's actions are based on the French Data Protection Act (Article 82), its guidelines, the recommendation on cookies, and the final report on cookie banners adopted by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB). The CNIL urges all stakeholders to ensure their practices comply with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the ePrivacy Directive.

## Rule

The use of cookies requires the consent of data subjects, with some exceptions. The key principles that website publishers must follow when designing cookie banners are:

- **Ease of Rejection:** Rejecting cookies should be as easy as accepting them. This means the design should not disproportionately emphasize the acceptance option over the reject option.
- **Clarity and Completeness:** The information on the cookie banner must be clear and complete, specifying the purpose of any cookies and the means of rejecting them.
- **Avoidance of Dark Patterns:** Designs that mislead users or make it difficult to reject cookies are considered violations. Specifically, these include:
    - Presenting the reject option as a less noticeable clickable link (e.g., with a smaller font, different color, or different font style).
    - Embedding the reject option in a way that makes it difficult to find. 
    - Placing the reject option with insufficient spacing so it blends in with other information. 
    - Presenting the accept option multiple times while the reject option is presented only once and in non-explicit terms.
- **Legal Basis**: The CNIL considers these types of dark patterns violations of the French Data Protection Act (art. 82). Website publishers must modify their cookie consent banners within one month to ensure valid consent.
