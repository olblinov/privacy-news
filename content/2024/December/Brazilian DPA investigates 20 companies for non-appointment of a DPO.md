# Summary

The Autoridade Nacional de Proteção de Dados (ANPD) is **investigating 20 large companies** for failing to designate a Data Protection Officer (Encarregado) and provide adequate communication channels for data subjects, as required by the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (LGPD). This action is part of the Monitoring Cycle and aligns with the 2024-2025 Priority Themes Map, which emphasizes guaranteeing data subjects’ rights. The absence of an Encarregado or effective communication channel prevents data subjects from exercising their rights and undermines transparency in the processing of personal information, thus hindering the ANPD's ability to ensure compliance with the LGPD.

# Detail

## Factual Background

- The ANPD initiated a **monitoring process involving 20 large companies** that did not indicate the contact of the Encarregado for the processing of personal data, as required by Article 41 of the LGPD.
- The investigation also extends to organizations that do not provide an adequate communication channel to serve data subjects, or offer channels that are not effective, making it difficult to exercise rights such as access, correction and deletion of personal data.
- The **companies being investigated** span various economic sectors such as technology, telecommunications, education, health and retail.
- The list of companies includes BlueFit, TikTok, Dell, Equatorial Energia, Clínica Vamos Sorrir, Eventim, Quinto Andar, Hurb, Cacau Show, Latam Airlines, Open English, Tinder, Saúde Total, UniNassau, Serasa, Jequiti Cosméticos, Vivo, Telegram, Uber, and X Corp./Twitter.
- The ANPD received reports that some companies, even when they had indicated a contact channel, that the channel did not properly fulfill its function of mediating the relationship between the data subject and the controller.

## Violation

- The companies **failed to designate a Data Protection Officer** (Encarregado).
- The companies also either **failed to provide an adequate communication channel** for data subjects or the communication channels they provided were not effective.
- These violations **impede data subjects from exercising their rights**.
- These violations **compromise the transparency** in the processing of personal information.
- The violations **hinder the ANPD's ability** to ensure compliance with the LGPD.

## Sanction

- The purpose of the investigation is to ensure that the notified companies comply with legal requirements, and **regularize** the designation of an Encarregado and/or a functional communication channel.
- If the irregularities persist, the organizations may be subject to **administrative sanctioning processes**, which include the application of penalties provided for in Article 52 of the LGPD, such as warnings and fines.
