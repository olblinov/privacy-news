# Summary

The Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) reached a settlement with **Meta Platforms, Inc.**, regarding the Cambridge Analytica incident, resulting in a **$50 million payment program** for affected Australian Facebook users. The settlement resolves concerns that some Australian Facebook users' personal information was disclosed to the "This is Your Digital Life" app, which exposed the data to potential misuse, including for political profiling. The agreement includes Meta establishing a payment scheme managed by an independent third party. This settlement is the largest payment to address individual privacy concerns in Australia.

# Details

## Background

The issue stems from the **Cambridge Analytica incident**, where the personal information of Facebook users was accessed through a third-party app called "This is Your Digital Life" (Life App). This app, launched in 2013 by Dr. Aleksandr Kogan, used the **Graph API** to access user data and their friends' data. Meta's investigation revealed that Dr. Kogan and his company, **Global Science Research Limited (GSR)**, transferred user information to **Cambridge Analytica** and **Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL)**, in violation of their agreement with Meta. The OAIC commenced an investigation into Meta in 2018, alleging that Meta may have interfered with the privacy of Australian individuals in contravention of Australian Privacy Principles (APPs). The Commissioner alleged that Meta's systems and practices raised concerns about the protection of personal information of Australian Facebook users in relation to the Cambridge Analytica incident. Approximately 53 users in Australia installed the Life App, and the personal information of 311,074 Australian Facebook users could have been accessed as friends of those who installed the app. The OAIC began civil penalty proceedings in the Federal Court in March 2020. The court-ordered mediation led to the current settlement.

## Legal Analysis

The OAIC alleged that Meta may have contravened section 13G of the _Privacy Act_ through serious or repeated breaches of APPs 6.1 and 11.1. The settlement was reached without any admission of liability from Meta. The settlement is part of an enforceable undertaking (EU) under the _Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act 2014_. Meta is obligated to implement a payment program for eligible Australian users. The **enforceable undertaking** requires Meta to establish a payment scheme administered by a third party, which will be open to Australian users who held a Facebook account between November 2, 2013, and December 17, 2015, were in Australia for more than 30 days during that period, and either installed the Life App or were friends with someone who did.

## Sanction

Meta will provide **$50 million** for the payment program. The payment scheme has **two tiers**: a base payment for those who experienced generalized concern or embarrassment, and a potentially higher payment for those who can demonstrate specific loss or damage. The payment program will be administered by an independent third party that Meta will appoint. The third-party administrator will publicize the program and Meta will make reasonable efforts to notify potentially impacted users. The third party will also establish an internal review process. Any residual funds from the payment program will be paid into the Commonwealthâ€™s Consolidated Revenue Fund. In addition, Meta made a contribution to the Commissioner's legal costs. The OAIC has withdrawn the civil penalty proceedings in the Federal Court as part of the resolution.
