# Summary

This document from the Data State Inspectorate of Latvia clarifies when the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to data processing in social media groups. The applicability hinges on factors such as the **accessibility of the group, its connection to commercial or professional activities, and the identifiability of individuals within the data processed**. Generally, if a group is public or linked to professional activities, the GDPR is likely to apply. However, there are exceptions, such as for groups used for personal purposes or in cases of freedom of expression or journalism.

# Detail

## Factual Background

The Data State Inspectorate is a direct administration institution under the supervision of the Cabinet of Ministers, and it acts as a personal data processing supervisory body. It is tasked with fulfilling the duties outlined in the General Data Protection Regulation and other regulatory acts related to the processing of personal data. The Inspectorate publishes annual reports, maintains lists of data protection specialists and credit bureaus, and offers resources such as a tool for data processing risk assessment and a code of conduct. The Inspectorate also provides clarifications, opinions, and handles complaints related to data protection violations. It also offers public consultations on data processing and protection.

## Rule

The applicability of the Data Regulation (GDPR) to social network groups depends on several factors:

- **Accessibility**: If a group is public and has unrestricted access, the processing of personal data within it generally falls under the GDPR. Conversely, closed groups with restricted access, typically used for personal purposes, are not usually subject to the GDPR.
- **Commercial or Professional Connection**: Groups created for purposes linked to commercial activities or professional relationships are subject to the GDPR. This includes communication regarding service provision, or when an organization's employees process data within a group. For example, a school using a WhatsApp group to communicate with parents or an apartment building manager using a group to communicate with residents are subject to the GDPR.
- **Identifiability of Individuals**: For the GDPR to apply, the individuals within the processed data must be clearly identifiable. A publication must contain a person's identifier, such as a clear face image, name or contact information. If a person cannot be recognized from the published information alone without additional information, they are not considered clearly identifiable.
- **Exceptions**: Exceptions to the GDPR can be made in cases where data processing occurs for the purpose of freedom of expression or journalism.
