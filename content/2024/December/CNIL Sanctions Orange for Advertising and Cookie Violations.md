# Summary

The Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL) has sanctioned Orange SA with a 50 million euro fine for violations related to advertising practices and cookie management. The company was found to have displayed advertisements that appeared as emails within users' inboxes without consent, and continued to read cookies after users had withdrawn their consent, thereby contravening the regulations in the code des postes et des communications électroniques (CPCE) and the loi Informatique et Libertés. The CNIL stated that accessing stored information without consent is a violation, even if the information is not subsequently used. In addition to the fine, the CNIL has ordered Orange to rectify its practices regarding cookie management and has imposed a daily penalty of 100,000 euros for non-compliance after a three-month period.

# Detail

## Factual Background

- Orange SA is a major telecommunications operator, serving both individual and corporate clients with fixed-line, broadband internet, and mobile services.
- The company provides an email service called "Mail Orange," which is accessible via its website orange.fr, managed by the groupement d’intérêt économique ORANGE PORTAILS.
- Orange holds a substantial market share in France, with 39.5% for internet and 34% for mobile services.
- The CNIL conducted two separate online audits of Orange’s practices in 2023, focusing on the "Mail Orange" service and general data processing activities.
- The CNIL initiated these investigations following decisions by the president of the Commission in March and June of 2023.
- The CNIL found that Orange was displaying ads within users' inboxes without obtaining prior consent.
- The CNIL also found that Orange continued to read cookies on users' devices after consent had been withdrawn.
- Orange ceased displaying ads in the manner that was found to be in violation in November 2023.

## Violation

- **Advertising Without Consent**: Orange violated **article L. 34-5 of the CPCE** by displaying advertisements that appeared as emails within users' inboxes, without obtaining their prior consent. The CNIL determined this to be a form of direct marketing, requiring explicit user consent, based on a ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). The CNIL stated that Orange controlled the advertising space and therefore was responsible for obtaining consent. The CNIL found that the company did not collect consent for these advertisements. #change #direct_marketing 
- **Cookie Mismanagement**: Orange also violated **article 82 of the loi Informatique et Libertés** by continuing to read cookies on users' devices after they had withdrawn their consent. The CNIL stated that accessing stored information without consent is a violation, even if the information is not subsequently used. The CNIL specified that companies need to implement measures to prevent reading of cookies after consent is withdrawn. #cookies #change

## Sanction

- **Fine**: The CNIL imposed a **50 million euro fine** on Orange for the aforementioned violations. This amount was determined considering the severity of the violations, the number of people impacted, and Orange's position as a market leader in France. The CNIL also factored in the financial advantage gained by Orange from displaying the unauthorized advertisements.
- **Injunction**: The CNIL issued an injunction to Orange, requiring the company to implement measures to ensure that cookies are not read after users withdraw their consent.
- **Daily Penalty**: The injunction was accompanied by a daily penalty of **100,000 euros for each day of delay** after a three-month deadline, to ensure compliance.
- **Public Announcement**: The CNIL has made its decision public, as is its right under article 22 of the loi Informatique et Libertés. The decision will be published on the CNIL's website and on Légifrance, and will not identify Orange by name after two years.
