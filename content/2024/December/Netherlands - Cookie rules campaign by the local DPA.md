# Cookie Policies

- A good cookie policy is essential for building trust with website visitors.
- Organizations should be transparent about their use of cookies, as cookies can impact user privacy.
- Itâ€™s important to consider if all the cookies an organization wants to use are necessary, and if the collected data is actually needed.
- Collecting more data than needed is not allowed.
- If cookies present a high privacy risk, a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) must be conducted to mitigate risks.
- Organizations must request consent properly for placing cookies, except for functional cookies.
- It's important to explain which types of cookies are being used and their purposes, ideally within a cookie or privacy statement that is easily accessible and written in clear language.
- The policy should disclose if data is shared with third parties, including which organizations and why.
- The duration that cookies are active, and the measures for data security should also be provided.
- Organizations should seek professional advice if they are unsure about their cookie policy.

# Cookiewalls

- A cookiewall, which requires users to accept tracking cookies to access a website, is generally not allowed under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
- Users must have the option to refuse tracking cookies without being denied access to the website or app.
- A cookiewall does not provide a genuine or free choice, as refusing cookies results in denial of access.
- This explanation about cookiewalls also applies to similar technologies that require consent, including Javascripts, Flash cookies, HTML5-local storage, and web beacons.

# Cookie Banners

- Cookie banners explain to website visitors how their personal data is being collected with cookies and why, allowing users to choose which cookies they consent to.
- Organizations must avoid misleading practices, such as automatically ticking options.
- If tracking cookies or similar technologies are used, it is assumed that personal data is being processed, requiring compliance with the GDPR.
- Users must have the ability to refuse cookies without any negative consequences.
- Clear information about the use of cookies allows website visitors to make informed decisions.
- The Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP) monitors organizations' handling of personal data and can take action if rules are not followed.
- The processing of personal data via cookies is typically based on consent.
    - Consent must be given before cookies are placed.
    - Users must actively give consent.
    - It must be clear that the cookie banner is requesting consent.
    - Consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous.
    - Users should be able to withdraw their consent easily.
    - Users must be well-informed about how cookies are used and for what purposes.
- The legal basis of legitimate interest is generally not applicable for cookies, except for functional and limited analytical cookies, like those for website security. #change 
- There are nine guidelines for creating a clear cookie banner:
    - Provide information about the purpose of the cookies.
    - Do not automatically check boxes.
    - Use clear text.
    - Present all choices on one layer.
    - Do not hide certain choices. 
    - Do not require extra clicks to refuse cookies.
    - Do not use inconspicuous links in text.
    - Be clear about how to withdraw consent.
    - Do not confuse consent with legitimate interest.
- These rules apply not only to cookies, but also to similar techniques such as local storage, tracking pixels, web beacons, and fingerprinting.
- The first layer of a cookie banner must clearly state who is processing personal data and for what purposes.
- Users must be able to withdraw their consent at any time, as easily as giving it, without costs or negative consequences.
- Information about withdrawing consent should be provided before consent is given.
- If consent involves third parties, those parties must be informed of the withdrawal.
