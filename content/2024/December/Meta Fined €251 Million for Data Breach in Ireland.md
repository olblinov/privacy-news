# Summary

The Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) has fined Meta Platforms Ireland Limited (MPIL) **€251 million** following two inquiries into a personal data breach that impacted approximately 29 million Facebook accounts globally, with about 3 million of those in the EU/EEA. The data breach occurred in September 2018, arising from the exploitation of user tokens by unauthorized third parties. The DPC found that MPIL had infringed several articles of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), including those related to breach notification, documentation of breaches, and data protection by design and by default.

# Details

## Background

The DPC launched its own inquiries after a personal data breach was reported by MPIL in September 2018. The breach was caused by the deployment of a video upload function on Facebook in July 2017 that interacted with the 'View As' feature. This allowed users to see their profiles as others would. A flaw in the combination of the video uploader and the ‘Happy Birthday Composer’ feature resulted in the generation of user tokens that gave unauthorized users full access to other users' profiles. Between September 14 and 28, 2018, unauthorized individuals used scripts to exploit this vulnerability, logging into approximately 29 million Facebook accounts globally. Facebook security personnel were alerted to the vulnerability due to an increase in video upload activity and removed the feature. The categories of personal data affected included user’s full name, email address, phone number, location, place of work, date of birth, religion, gender, posts on timelines, groups of which a user was a member, and children’s personal data.

## Legal Analysis

The DPC found that MPIL violated several articles of the GDPR. These infringements include:

- **Article 33(3) GDPR**: Failure to include all required information in its breach notification. MPIL was reprimanded and fined €8 million for this. #change 
- **Article 33(5) GDPR**: Failure to adequately document the facts, remedial steps taken, and verification of compliance for each breach. MPIL was reprimanded and fined €3 million for this. #change 
- **Article 25(1) GDPR**: Failure to ensure data protection principles were incorporated into the design of processing systems. MPIL was reprimanded and fined €130 million. 
- **Article 25(2) GDPR**: Failure to ensure that by default, only necessary personal data is processed for specific purposes. MPIL was reprimanded and fined €110 million.

## Sanction

The DPC issued a total administrative fine of **€251 million** to MPIL for these GDPR infringements. The DPC also issued a number of reprimands to MPIL for its failures related to the GDPR articles. Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle emphasized that the enforcement action highlights the serious risks and harms to individuals resulting from the failure to build in data protection requirements throughout the design and development cycle. The DPC submitted a draft decision to the GDPR cooperation mechanism in September 2024, and no objections were raised.
