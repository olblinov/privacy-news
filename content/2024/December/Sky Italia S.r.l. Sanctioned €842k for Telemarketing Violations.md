# Summary

The Italian Data Protection Authority (Garante per la protezione dei dati personali) has sanctioned Sky Italia S.r.l. for violating data protection regulations related to telemarketing practices. The company was found to have contacted individuals for promotional purposes without proper consent, including those registered on the Public Register of Oppositions (RPO) and those who had not given explicit consent to be contacted. Additionally, Sky was cited for sending promotional SMS messages to users of its "NOW" service without their consent. The Garante has issued a fine of €842,062.00 and has ordered Sky to cease its unlawful data processing activities.

# Detail

## Factual Background

- The Garante initiated an investigation into Sky Italia following 275 complaints about telemarketing calls between April 1, 2022, and March 28, 2023.
- Sky initially claimed to have contacted only 95 of the 275 individuals legitimately.
- The company stated that some contacts were made with prior consent, some through "Direct Email Marketing" or SMS requests, and some were for customer service.
- Sky also stated that 179 calls were not attributable to them or their providers and that all 275 numbers were added to Sky's blacklist.
- The Garante requested a list of Sky's sales proposals that led to service activations between March 6 and March 13, 2023.
- The Garante cross-referenced the list of phone numbers against the Public Register of Oppositions (RPO) and found that 644 numbers that Sky contacted were registered on the RPO.
- The Garante also investigated a complaint about an unwanted SMS message from the "NOW TV!" service that was sent without the user's consent.
- Sky said that the SMS was a service communication, not marketing, but the Garante found that the message had promotional content.
- Sky argued that the administrative procedure was not completed within the required 120 days, but the Garante rejected this claim.

## Violation

- **Contacting numbers on the Public Register of Oppositions:** Sky contacted 644 numbers registered on the RPO, violating Article 130 of the Code regarding electronic communications, and Articles 5 and 6 of the GDPR.
- **Contacting prospects without consent:** Sky contacted 92 potential customers (prospects) without proper consent. Specifically, 17 of these were contacted via SMS through third party providers without adequate proof of consent, and some of the prospects were contacted before they had interacted with Sky on their website.
- **Sending promotional SMS messages without consent:** Sky sent an SMS promoting the "NOW" service to a user without their consent, which was a violation of Article 6 of the GDPR and Article 130 of the Code.
- **Issues with consent:** The Garante found that Sky did not adequately verify consent from third-party sources, including that consents were not specific, that some consents were bundled together with other purposes, that Sky did not adequately document consent, that some consents were from years ago without adequate re-verification, and that some of the third parties lacked the proper legal representation within the EU.
- **Inadequate information for "Call Me Now":** Sky did not properly document the consent associated with its "Call Me Now" service.
- **Misuse of "legitimate interest":** The Garante found that the use of "legitimate interest" as a basis for telemarketing was not in accordance with Article 130 of the Code.

## Sanction

- The Garante imposed a fine of **€842,062.00** on Sky Italia S.r.l..
- The Garante prohibited Sky from further processing personal data for commercial purposes without adequate checks on consent and without consulting the Public Register of Oppositions.

- Sky was ordered to properly document how consent is obtained via its “Call Me Now” service.
- Sky was prohibited from further processing personal data associated with NOW accounts without consent for marketing.
