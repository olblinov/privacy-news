# Summary

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has filed a complaint against Mobilewalla, Inc., a data broker, for allegedly collecting and selling sensitive consumer location data without proper consent. Mobilewalla gathers vast amounts of personal information, including precise location data tied to individuals, from sources like real-time bidding (RTB) exchanges and data brokers. This information is then used to create audience segments based on sensitive characteristics, such as health conditions and religious beliefs, and sold to third parties for various purposes including advertising, political campaigns, and government use. The FTC alleges that these practices violate the FTC Act by causing substantial injury to consumers through loss of privacy and potential exposure to discrimination and other harms.

# Detail

## Factual Background

- **Mobilewalla's Business:** Mobilewalla operates as a data broker, collecting and aggregating consumer information, primarily location data, from various sources rather than directly from consumers. The company claims to create a comprehensive view of customers by understanding their online and offline behavior.
- **Data Collection:** Mobilewalla primarily collects data from real-time bidding (RTB) exchanges and other data brokers and aggregators. RTB exchanges facilitate the delivery of ads to mobile devices, and Mobilewalla collects consumer data even when it does not win an ad bid. The data collected includes MAIDs (mobile advertising identifiers) and precise geolocation information.
- **Data Volume:** Between 2018 and 2020, Mobilewalla collected approximately 77 million unique advertising identifiers paired with location data in 2018, over 273 million in 2019, and approximately 269 million in 2020. In total, Mobilewalla estimates that it collected more than 2 billion unique advertising identifiers during this period.
- **Data Usage:** Mobilewalla uses the collected location data to create audience segments based on interests or characteristics inferred from the locations visited by consumers, and sells this data to third parties. These audience segments are used for targeted advertising, political campaigning, and government purposes.
- **Custom Audience Segments:** Mobilewalla creates custom audience segments for its clients, such as an audience segment specifically targeting pregnant women and young mothers. They have also created segments based on sensitive characteristics like Hispanic churchgoers and members of the LGBTQ+ community.
- **Sensitive Location Tracking:** Mobilewalla's data allows the tracking of consumers to sensitive locations such as medical facilities, places of worship, LGBTQ+ community centers, and domestic abuse shelters. This precise geolocation data can be used to infer sensitive information about consumers.
- **Data Retention:** Mobilewalla retains collected data indefinitely, claiming to store over five years of data, allowing for long-term tracking of individuals' movements.

## Violation

- **Unfair Sale of Sensitive Location Data:** The FTC alleges that Mobilewalla's sale of precise location data associated with MAIDs is an unfair act because it reveals consumers’ visits to sensitive locations and can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information about consumers’ private lives.
- **Unfair Targeting Based on Sensitive Characteristics:** The FTC also alleges that Mobilewalla's practice of categorizing consumers into audience segments based on sensitive characteristics, such as medical conditions and religious beliefs, is unfair. These segments are then sold to third parties for marketing and other purposes, increasing the risk of privacy loss and discrimination. #sensitive 
- **Unfair Collection of Data from RTB Exchanges:** According to the complaint, Mobilewalla unfairly collected consumer information from RTB exchanges, even when it did not have a winning bid, violating the terms of the RTB exchanges and using the data for non-advertising purposes. #change 
- **Unfair Collection and Use Without Consent Verification:** Mobilewalla collects and uses location information without taking reasonable steps to verify that consumers have consented to the collection and use of their location data. The company relies on vague contractual assurances from suppliers and fails to verify the accuracy of the certifications.
- **Unfair Data Retention:** Mobilewalla's indefinite retention of sensitive location information is considered unfair by the FTC, as it increases the risk of harm to consumers, including potential for stalking, targeted scams, and reputational damage.

## Sanction

- **Proposed Settlement Order:** The FTC has proposed a settlement order that includes several key provisions designed to prevent Mobilewalla from engaging in future unfair practices.
- **Banned Activities:**
    - Mobilewalla will be prohibited from selling sensitive location data, specifically that related to health clinics, religious organizations, and other sensitive locations.
    - Mobilewalla is prohibited from collecting or retaining consumer data from online advertising auctions for any purpose other than participating in the auction.
    - The company must establish a sensitive location data program designed to prevent the use, sale, or disclosure of such data.
    - Mobilewalla must provide consumers a method to request deletion of their location data.
- **Required Actions:**
    - Mobilewalla must create a comprehensive privacy program to protect consumers' personal information.
    - The company must set up a supplier assessment program to confirm that consumers have consented to the collection and use of their location data.
    - Mobilewalla must provide a method for consumers to withdraw consent for the use of their data and must stop collecting that data after withdrawal.
- **Consequences of Noncompliance:** Each violation of the final consent order may result in a civil penalty of up to $51,744.
- **Public Comment:** The agreement is subject to a 30-day public comment period after publication in the Federal Register.
