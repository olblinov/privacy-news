# Summary

The Autoridade Nacional de Proteção de Dados (ANPD), Brazil's National Data Protection Authority, has released a guidance document to clarify the role of the data protection officer (DPO), known as "encarregado" in Portuguese, and to aid organizations in complying with the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD), Brazil's General Data Protection Law. The guide details the responsibilities, required qualifications, and the process for appointing a DPO, as well as providing insights into good practices for personal data handling. It emphasizes the DPO's function as a communication channel between data subjects, data controllers, and the ANPD. The guide also includes model documents for the formal appointment of a DPO.

# Details

## Introduction to the Encarregado

- The "encarregado," or DPO, was established by the LGPD to act as a communication link between the data controller, data subjects, and the ANPD.
- The DPO is also responsible for advising employees and contractors of the data controller on data protection practices.
- The term "encarregado" is the equivalent of Data Protection Officer (DPO) in the English version of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), though their activities and responsibilities are not identical due to originating from distinct legal systems.
- The ANPD is authorized to issue regulations on the DPO's definition and responsibilities, including situations where the appointment of a DPO can be waived.
- This guide provides a detailed explanation of the DPO’s role, aiming to help society understand the rules and ensure compliance with the LGPD.

## Data Processing Agents and the Appointment of the Encarregado

- Data controllers and operators are considered data processing agents.
- A controller is legally required to appoint a DPO, whereas it is optional for an operator but considered a good practice.
- In the public sector, each linked body may require its own DPO depending on its structure and responsibilities.
- For instance, different municipal secretariats may each appoint a DPO, or the municipality may designate a single DPO to oversee the entire structure.
- The DPO should preferably be a public servant with a clean record, appointed through a formal act and publicized.

## Exemptions from Appointing an Encarregado

- Small-sized data processing agents may be exempt from appointing a DPO.
- However, this exemption does not apply to those who: engage in high-risk data processing, have an annual gross revenue exceeding R$4,800,000.00 (or R$16,000,000.00 for startups) or belong to an economic group exceeding these limits.
- Even if exempt, small data processing agents must provide a channel for data subjects to communicate with them.
- The appointment of a DPO is considered a good practice for operators, even if not mandatory.
- The guide provides an example of a small medical home care company that is not exempt from appointing a DPO because it processes sensitive health data.

## How to Appoint an Encarregado

- The appointment of a DPO in the public sector can be made by the highest authority or delegated as per administrative rules.
- In the private sector, the appointment is done by the appropriate manager, following the company’s contract or bylaws.
- The appointment must be formalized in a written, dated, and signed document.
- The formal act of appointment does not need to be communicated to the ANPD, but it must be kept by the data processing agent and presented when requested.
- Public entities must publish the DPO’s appointment in the Official Gazette.
- The identity and contact information of the DPO must be clearly and objectively published on the data controller's website, in a prominent and easily accessible location.

## Who Can Be Appointed as Encarregado

- The DPO can be an individual (e.g., an employee) or a legal entity contracted for the purpose.
- Public entities should preferably appoint public servants with a good reputation as DPOs.
- The DPO must be able to communicate in Portuguese, Brazil’s official language.
- An organizational unit without legal personality cannot be appointed as a DPO.
- The guide gives an example of a lawyer from Puerto Rico working for a company in Colombia who can be appointed as DPO as they are fluent in Portuguese and knowledgeable about the LGPD.

## Absence, Impediment, and Vacancy

- Absences, impediments, or vacancies of the DPO should not hinder the rights of data subjects or the communications of the ANPD.
- In such cases, a formally designated substitute should assume the DPO’s responsibilities.
- The substitute's appointment should follow the same procedures as the primary DPO.

## Identity and Contact Information

- The DPO’s identity and contact information must be publicly disclosed.
- For individuals, the full name must be disclosed, and for legal entities, the company name and the full name of the responsible individual must be disclosed.
- Contact information should include details that allow data subjects to exercise their rights and enable the ANPD to communicate with the DPO.
- The preferred means of publication is the data controller’s website; however, if the data controller does not have one, other means of communication can be used.
- The information should be kept up-to-date and easily accessible.

## Responsibilities of the Data Processing Agents

- Data processing agents must provide the necessary resources for the DPO to perform their duties.
- They must seek the DPO’s advice when making decisions regarding data processing.
- The DPO must have technical autonomy, free from undue interference.
- Data processing agents must provide data subjects with a means to contact the DPO easily.
- The DPO must have direct access to senior management and other relevant departments.
- Data processing agents need to ensure that DPOs have the necessary technical and administrative conditions to perform their duties.

## Characteristics and Activities of the Encarregado

- The DPO provides assistance in multidisciplinary activities for the protection of data subjects’ privacy and personal data.
- The data controller is responsible for setting the DPO’s required qualifications, considering their knowledge of data protection laws, the context, volume, and risk of data processing operations.
- The DPO should have knowledge of data protection legislation, risk management, data governance, compliance, auditing, and information security.
- No specific professional registration, education, or certification is required to be a DPO.
- The DPO is responsible for accepting complaints and communications from data subjects, providing clarifications, receiving communications from the ANPD, advising on data protection practices, and other duties assigned by the data controller.
- The DPO does not make decisions regarding data processing; the controller is responsible for that.
- The DPO must assist in handling requests from the ANPD, including forwarding requests internally, providing guidance to the data controller, and indicating the data controller’s representative to the ANPD, if not the DPO.
- The DPO advises the data controller on creating and implementing data protection measures, including incident response and recording of personal data processing operations.
- The DPO can be part of incident response teams, guiding on incident reporting and communication.
- The DPO can also assist in the preparation of Data Protection Impact Reports (RIPD).

## Conflict of Interest

- A conflict of interest is any situation that may improperly compromise the DPO's objectivity and technical judgment.
- The DPO must act with ethics, integrity, and technical autonomy.
- The DPO should not hold positions that involve making strategic decisions about data processing, like human resources, IT, or finance positions.
- A DPO can work for multiple organizations as long as they are able to perform their responsibilities for each agent and conflicts of interest are avoided.
- The DPO must declare any potential conflicts of interest to the data controller.
- Data processing agents must analyze the possibility of a conflict of interest before appointing a DPO.
- If a conflict of interest is identified, the data controller should not appoint the person, implement measures to remove the risk, or replace the appointed DPO.

## Additional Information

- The guide includes models for the formal act of appointing a DPO, both for individuals and legal entities.
- The guide provides a number of footnotes with references to various articles from the LGPD and other legislation related to data protection in Brazil.
