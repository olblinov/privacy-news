# Summary

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has approved a final order against Rytr, a company that offered an AI service that generated fake online reviews. The FTC complaint alleged that Rytr's service created detailed reviews, with specific details that did not relate to user input, and that would almost certainly be false for users who copied them and posted them online. The FTC concluded that the service was likely to pollute the marketplace with a glut of fake reviews, harming consumers and honest competitors. The final order prohibits Rytr from offering this type of service in the future.

# Details

## Background

Rytr is a company that provides an AI "writing assistant" service through its Rytr.me website. The service generates written content for users across 43 different use cases including emails, product descriptions, blogs, and testimonials and reviews. Rytr offers both free and paid access, with paid subscriptions costing $9-$29 per month, depending on character limits. Since April 2021, Rytr has offered a "Testimonial & Review" feature that allows users to generate written reviews. To generate these reviews, the user selects the output language, tone, and inputs keywords, phrases, and titles. The service then generates detailed reviews with little user effort. The FTC noted that Rytr's service generated detailed reviews with specific, often material details that had no relation to the user’s input. For example, when a user input “Gucci GG Canvas Messenger Bag Replica Red 449172,” the service generated a detailed review about the bag's features, such as its carrying capacity and material, even though this information was not part of the user's input.

## Legal Analysis

The FTC's complaint alleged that Rytr violated the FTC Act by providing subscribers with the means to generate false and deceptive written content for reviews, and that the company engaged in an unfair business practice by offering a service likely to create a large number of fake reviews. The FTC concluded that the service was likely to cause harm to consumers because they rely on reviews for accurate information about products and services, and that fake reviews can give consumers a false impression of a product or service's quality. The FTC further concluded that consumers cannot reasonably avoid the harm because fake reviews appear authentic enough to make it difficult to distinguish them from real reviews. The FTC stated that the harm caused by Rytr’s service was not outweighed by any benefit to consumers or competition. The FTC argues that the company was providing the means to deceive with its Testimonial & Review service.

## Sanction

The final order prohibits Rytr from engaging in similar illegal conduct in the future. The company is also barred from advertising, promoting, marketing, or selling any service dedicated to, or promoted as, generating consumer reviews or testimonials.
