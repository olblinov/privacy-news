# Summary

The Italian Data Protection Authority (Garante) concluded its investigation into **OpenAI's ChatGPT** service, imposing a **€15 million fine** and requiring a six-month information campaign due to violations of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The investigation, initiated in March 2023, found that OpenAI processed user data without a proper legal basis, lacked transparency in its data practices, and failed to implement age verification mechanisms, potentially exposing minors to inappropriate content. The Garante has transferred the case to the Irish Data Protection Authority (DPC), as OpenAI has established its European headquarters in Ireland, to continue investigations into ongoing violations.

# Details

## Background

- The Garante launched an investigation into ChatGPT in March 2023 following a data breach and concerns over data processing practices.
- The investigation was initiated because of concerns that OpenAI did not have adequate user information or a legal basis for processing data, and lacked age verification for users.
- The Garante issued an **urgent order** in March 2023, temporarily limiting data processing of Italian users, which was lifted after OpenAI implemented measures to comply with data protection regulations.
- OpenAI was instructed to provide a **privacy policy**, modify the legal basis for data processing, and develop a plan for age verification.
- OpenAI was also asked to conduct an information campaign, but the Garante found the initial campaign inadequate as it was not agreed upon beforehand.
- The Garante requested information from OpenAI regarding ChatGPT's functioning, data processing, and the March 2023 data breach.
- OpenAI stated that the data used to train its models came from publicly available internet sources, licensed third-party data, and user data.
- OpenAI identified its legal basis for data processing as legitimate interest. #legitimate_interest 
- The Garante initiated a formal proceeding against OpenAI in January 2024.
- OpenAI established its European headquarters in Ireland on February 15, 2024.

## Legal Analysis

- The Garante found that **OpenAI violated Article 33** of the GDPR by failing to notify the data breach to the Italian authority within 72 hours.
- OpenAI did notify the Irish Data Protection Authority, but because there was no main or single EU location at the time of the data breach, the Italian authority was the correct authority for notification.
- The Garante determined that **OpenAI violated Articles 5 and 6** of the GDPR by not identifying a lawful basis for processing personal data before the service was made public in November 2022, specifically for training its AI models. #legitimate_interest 
- OpenAI also failed to provide adequate information to users and non-users regarding data collection and processing for training purposes, violating **Articles 5, 12, and 13 of the GDPR**. #transparency 
- The Garante also highlighted that the privacy policy was only available in English at the time.
- The Garante also found that OpenAI violated **Articles 8, 24, and 25** for not having systems in place to verify user age, which exposed minors to inappropriate content. #minors 
- The Garante also noted that although OpenAI provided pop-up warnings about the potential inaccuracies of the AI, these warnings did not satisfy their obligations regarding data accuracy.
- The Garante stated that although OpenAI has implemented measures to reduce inaccuracies, the issue is ongoing.
- The Garante also determined that OpenAI failed to comply with the Garante's order to conduct an information campaign that was pre-approved by the Garante.
- The Garante determined that the Italian authority has jurisdiction over violations that occurred prior to OpenAI establishing its European headquarters in Ireland.
### Legal Basis

The Italian Data Protection Authority (Garante) determined that OpenAI used incorrect legal bases for processing personal data.

Specifically, the Garante found that OpenAI did not have a proper legal basis for processing personal data for the purpose of training its AI models, before the service was made public. OpenAI claimed to rely on the following legal bases:

- For providing the ChatGPT service to users, OpenAI stated that the legal basis was **contractual**.
- For training its AI models, OpenAI stated that the legal basis was **legitimate interest**.

However, the Garante determined that OpenAI had not properly identified a legal basis prior to beginning data processing. The Garante also stated that **OpenAI did not provide sufficient information** to users regarding the processing of their data, nor did they inform users of their rights.

The Garante stated that the correct legal bases should be either **consent or legitimate interest**, and that OpenAI should have made that determination before beginning to process user data.

- OpenAI was instructed to remove any reference to contract as the legal basis for the training of algorithms.
- OpenAI was told to use consent or legitimate interest as the basis for training data.
- OpenAI was instructed to provide tools for users to exercise their right to object to data processing for training purposes, in the event that legitimate interest is chosen as the legal basis.

Ultimately, the Garante determined that OpenAI could not demonstrate that it had identified a legal basis for data processing prior to the launch of ChatGPT. The Garante noted that OpenAI had updated its privacy policy to mention its legitimate interest in developing its services, but that this update was not made until March 2023, after ChatGPT had already launched in November 2022. The Garante also determined that the use of the term "legitimate interest" was unclear, and that OpenAI should have explicitly stated that the data processing was based on Article 6, par. 1, lett. f), of the GDPR, as well as the specific interests pursued.

## Sanction

- The Garante imposed a **€15 million fine** on OpenAI, taking into account the company's cooperation.
- OpenAI is required to conduct a **six-month information campaign** across major Italian media outlets to educate users about their rights and how to oppose data collection for AI training.
- The information campaign is also intended to promote awareness of how to exercise the right to oppose data use, correct inaccurate data, and request deletion.
- The Garante is transferring the case to the Irish DPC to investigate ongoing issues that had not been resolved prior to OpenAI’s establishment of their European headquarters.
- OpenAI has 60 days to submit a communication plan to the Garante, and the campaign must start within 45 days of the Garante's approval of that plan.
