# Summary

The Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) initiated a sanction procedure against OK Mobility España, S.L. for multiple violations of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The violations include: improper data retention practices, providing incorrect information about the data controller, and failure to properly respond to a data access request. OK Mobility initially faced a potential fine of €100,000, which was reduced to €60,000 after the company acknowledged responsibility and made a voluntary payment. The AEPD also mandated OK Mobility to take corrective actions to align its practices with GDPR.

# Details

## Background

- A complaint was filed against OK Mobility by an individual (A.A.A.) who had rented a car from the company in March 2023. The complainant requested access to their personal data but received no response. #rights 
- The complaint was initially lodged with the German data protection authority in Baden-Wurttemberg and subsequently transferred to the AEPD via the Internal Market Information System (IMI) because OK Mobility's primary establishment is in Spain.
- The AEPD's investigation revealed inconsistencies and violations within OK Mobility's data handling practices.
- The AEPD initiated a sanction procedure against OK Mobility España, S.L. for violations of Articles 5, 13, and 15 of the GDPR.
- The AEPD's investigation also involved cooperation with other European data protection authorities.

## Legal Analysis

- **Data Retention:** OK Mobility was found to be in violation of Article 5.1(e) of the GDPR, which mandates that personal data be kept for no longer than necessary. The company's privacy policy and responses to the AEPD's inquiries provided inconsistent and insufficient information regarding data retention periods. #retention 
	- Initially, OK Mobility's privacy policy stated that personal data would be kept:
		- As long as there was a contractual relationship with the customer.
		- After the contractual relationship ended, until the customer requested deletion of their data or as legally required if consent was given.
		- If deletion was requested, data would be blocked but still available to judicial and public authorities during the legal prescription period.
		- If litigation was pending related to invoices, data could be kept during the legal process for evidentiary purposes.
	- Later, in response to an inquiry from the AEPD, OK Mobility stated that the retention periods for data collected through its website:
		- Depended on the purpose for which the data was collected.
		- Had a **maximum retention period of 5 years**.
	- The AEPD noted that OK Mobility did not provide details about data retention periods based on the purpose of data processing, but instead provided a generic response that the maximum retention period was 5 years. The AEPD considered that this lack of clarity violated Article 5.1(e) of the GDPR, which requires that data be kept no longer than necessary and that the company must detail retention periods for specific purposes.
- **Transparency:** OK Mobility breached Article 13 of the GDPR by publishing an incorrect NIF (tax identification number) for the data controller on its website, as the listed NIF belonged to a company that had been inactive since January 2023. #transparency 
- **Access Rights:** The company failed to properly address a data access request from the complainant in May 2023, violating Article 15 of the GDPR. The company claimed the request was in German, and the requester's representation was not accredited. The AEPD found these reasons insufficient to deny the access request. The company also did not inform the data subject about their right to complain or take legal action. #rights 

## Sanction

- The AEPD initially proposed fines totaling €100,000 for the violations. This included:
    - €50,000 for the violation of Article 5 (data retention)
    - €30,000 for the violation of Article 13 (transparency)
    - €20,000 for the violation of Article 15 (access rights)
- OK Mobility was given the option to reduce the fine by 20% by acknowledging responsibility and another 20% by making a voluntary payment.
- By acknowledging responsibility and making a voluntary payment, OK Mobility's fine was reduced to €60,000.
- The AEPD also required OK Mobility to take specific corrective actions, including providing access to the complainant's personal data and adjusting data retention policies. OK Mobility informed the AEPD that it had taken the necessary steps to prevent future violations, but the AEPD did not confirm the measures' compliance. The AEPD highlighted the principle of proactive responsibility which requires data controllers to implement adequate measures and demonstrate compliance throughout the data lifecycle.
- The procedure was terminated after OK Mobility paid the reduced fine.
