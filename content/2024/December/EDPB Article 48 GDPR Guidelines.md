# Summary

These guidelines clarify Article 48 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which addresses the transfer or disclosure of personal data to third countries in response to court judgments or administrative decisions. The guidelines emphasize that such transfers are only permissible if based on an **international agreement** between the requesting third country and the EU or a Member State, without undermining other transfer options outlined in Chapter V of the GDPR. These guidelines provide practical recommendations for EU controllers and processors to navigate these requests, highlighting the need for a legal basis for processing under Article 6 and compliance with Chapter V of the GDPR for any data transfer.

# Detail

## Background

Article 48 of the GDPR is part of Chapter V, which deals with the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organizations. It stipulates that any judgment from a court or decision from an administrative authority in a third country requiring the transfer or disclosure of personal data by an EU controller or processor, can only be recognized or enforced if it's based on an international agreement. This ensures the legal sovereignty of the EU with respect to third country law. These guidelines focus on requests from third-country public authorities directly to private entities in the EU. The provision aims to protect personal data from the extraterritorial application of third country laws that may breach international law or impede the GDPR's protection of natural persons.

- The guidelines clarify that any disclosure of personal data to a third country authority constitutes a transfer under Chapter V of the GDPR.
- Article 48 does not distinguish between private or public controllers and processors but focuses on requests to private entities as the most common scenario.

## Rule

When responding to requests from third-country authorities, controllers and processors in the EU must meet several conditions:

- **Legal Basis (Article 6):** Any processing of personal data must have a legal basis under Article 6 of the GDPR.
    - Article 6(1)(c), in conjunction with Article 6(3), can be the appropriate legal basis if an international agreement exists and imposes a legal obligation.
    - Other legal bases under Article 6 may be considered if there is no international agreement, but must be examined on a case-by-case basis.
    - Consent under Article 6(1)(a) may not be appropriate in situations involving public authority requests.
    - Article 6(1)(b) cannot be relied upon by private entities in the EU.
    - Article 6(1)(e) may be used if cooperation is permitted under EU or Member State law and is in the public interest.
    - Article 6(1)(d) may be used for vital interests of the data subject, if conditions are met.
    - Article 6(1)(f) may be used in exceptional circumstances based on the legitimate interests of the controller.
- **Compliance with Chapter V:** Transfers must also comply with the conditions laid down in Chapter V of the GDPR.
    - Article 48 is not a ground for transfer, so controllers and processors must find a ground for transfer elsewhere in Chapter V.
    - If an international agreement exists, it can serve as a ground for transfer under Article 46(2)(a) if it provides appropriate safeguards.
    - These safeguards must ensure a level of data protection essentially equivalent to that guaranteed within the EU/EEA.
    - If no agreement exists or if an agreement doesn't provide sufficient safeguards, other grounds for transfer in Chapter V must be identified.
    - Derogations under Article 49 may apply in specific, limited situations, like public interest or legal claims, but these should be interpreted restrictively.
