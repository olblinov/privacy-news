Starting with 16 Feb 2025, Google's Platforms programs policies will be no longer prohibiting device fingerprints. The removed section sounded:
- You must not use device fingerprints or locally shared objects (e.g., Flash cookies, Browser Helper Objects, HTML5 local storage) other than HTTP cookies, or user-resettable mobile device identifiers designed for use in advertising, in connection with Google's platform products.Â This does not limit the use of IP address for the detection of fraud.

Instead, two new items are added:
- You must not engage in practices that circumvent or interfere with Google's advertising systems and processes, or make attempts to do so.
- Your ads must not simulate or impersonate the user interface of any web, app, or device feature, such as notifications or warning elements of a browser or operating system. It must be clear to the user which app, site, or property is serving each ad.
