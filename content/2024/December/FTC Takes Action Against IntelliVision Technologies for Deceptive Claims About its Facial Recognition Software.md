# Summary

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has filed a complaint against IntelliVision Technologies Corp. for making deceptive claims about its facial recognition software. The FTC alleges that IntelliVision misrepresented the accuracy and bias of its software, claiming it was among the most accurate on the market, had zero gender or racial bias, and was trained on millions of faces when this was not true. The company also allegedly made unsubstantiated claims about its anti-spoofing technology. The FTC's proposed settlement includes prohibitions on further misrepresentations by IntelliVision regarding its facial recognition technology.

# Detail

## Factual Background

- IntelliVision Technologies Corp. is a Delaware corporation based in San Jose, California, that develops and sells artificial intelligence-based facial recognition software to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), large integrators, and large end users.
- Their facial recognition software has been integrated into consumer products, including the 2GIG Edge home security system and the Elan Intelligent Touch Panel. These products allow users to register their faces and scan them for access.
- From late 2018 to early 2024, IntelliVision made claims on its website and in presentations about its facial recognition software. These claims included that the software is fast and accurate, can detect faces of all ethnicities without racial bias, and has anti-spoofing technology that cannot be fooled. The company also claimed its technology was trained using millions of faces from around the world.
- The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) conducts tests on facial recognition algorithms, and its findings show that accuracy rates vary based on demographics such as race and gender. NIST has found that many algorithms produce higher false positives for certain demographics, including West and East African, East Asian, and American Indian faces compared to Eastern European faces. False positives have also been found to be higher in women compared to men.
- IntelliVision submitted its algorithms to NIST for testing, and the results showed that error rates varied across different demographics, and the algorithms were not among the top-performing ones.

## Violation

- The FTC alleges that IntelliVision made false or misleading claims about the accuracy of its software. The company claimed its software had one of the highest accuracy rates on the market, which was not true.
- IntelliVision also misrepresented that its software was trained on millions of faces; instead, it was trained on approximately 100,000 unique individuals, with multiple variants created from those images.
- The company claimed that their software could detect faces of all ethnicities without racial bias, and performed with zero gender or racial bias. These claims were not substantiated.
- IntelliVision's claim that its anti-spoofing technology ensures the system cannot be fooled by a photo or video image was also found to be false or misleading, and lacked proper testing.
- These deceptive acts and practices violated Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act.

## Sanction

- Under the proposed consent order, IntelliVision will be prohibited from making misrepresentations about the accuracy, efficacy, and performance of its facial recognition technology, particularly regarding different genders, ethnicities, and skin tones.
- The company is also prohibited from misrepresenting the effectiveness of its technology in detecting spoofing.
- IntelliVision must possess and rely on competent and reliable testing before making claims about the effectiveness, accuracy, or lack of bias of its facial recognition technology.
- The consent order carries the force of law, and each violation may result in a civil penalty of up to $51,744.
- The consent agreement will be subject to a 30-day public comment period after publication in the Federal Register.
