# Summary

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has filed a complaint against Gravy Analytics and its subsidiary Venntel for the **unlawful sale of sensitive location data** that tracks consumers to sensitive locations, such as medical facilities and places of worship. The companies allegedly collected and sold precise geolocation data from mobile devices without obtaining verifiable user consent. They also categorized and sold consumer data based on sensitive characteristics like health, political activity, and religion. The FTC's proposed order would prohibit the companies from selling or using sensitive location data and would require them to implement a program to prevent such data from being used in the future.

# Detail

## Factual Background

- Gravy Analytics and Venntel are Delaware corporations that collect and sell consumer location data. Venntel is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gravy Analytics.
- They obtain location data from other data suppliers, who may acquire it from mobile apps or the mobile advertising marketplace.
- The companies claim to process over 17 billion signals daily from about a billion mobile devices.
- The location data is precise, using latitude and longitude coordinates, and is often accurate to within one meter.
- The companies use hand-drawn polygons to trace the shapes of locations being tracked to ensure accuracy.
- Gravy Analytics sells location data to commercial customers, while Venntel sells it to public sector customers, including government contractors.
- The data is delivered through file transfers or an Application Programming Interface (API).
- They offer tools such as geo-fencing, which allows customers to identify devices that were present at a specific location during a timeframe.
- Venntel provides enhanced tools that enable customers to track a single device, obtain device information, and search location signals associated with specific IP addresses.
- The companies also create and sell "audience segments," which are subsets of consumers who share interests or characteristics. These segments include sensitive categories such as health, medical decisions, political activity, and religious beliefs. 

## Violation

- The FTC alleges that the companies have violated the FTC Act by unfairly selling sensitive consumer location data and collecting and using data without obtaining verifiable consent.
- The companies collect, use, and sell precise geolocation data that identifies individual consumers and is not anonymized.
- They track consumers to sensitive locations, such as places of worship, medical facilities, and political events.
- The companies fail to take reasonable steps to confirm that consumers have consented to the collection, use, or sale of their location data.
- They continue to use location data even when they know that consumers have not given informed consent.
- The data is used for purposes wholly unrelated to the purpose consumers were told their location information would be used.
- The companies target consumers based on sensitive characteristics and behaviors.
- The location data reveals details about consumers' private lives that cannot be obtained through physical observation.
- The data can be used to identify medical facilities, places of worship, and daily patterns of consumers.
- The companies expose consumers to potential privacy harms including stigma, discrimination, violence, and other harms.
- The FTC says that the companies' practices have caused or are likely to cause "substantial injury" to consumers, which the consumers cannot avoid and which is not outweighed by countervailing benefits.

## Sanction

- The proposed order prohibits Gravy Analytics and Venntel from selling, licensing, transferring, sharing, disclosing, or using sensitive location data except for national security or law enforcement purposes.
- The order requires the companies to maintain a program to prevent the use, sale, transfer, or disclosure of consumer visits to sensitive locations such as medical facilities, religious organizations, correctional facilities, labor union offices, schools, services supporting people based on race and ethnicity, services sheltering the homeless, and military installations.
- The companies must delete all historic location data and data products developed using this data, unless it is deidentified or consumers have consented to its use.
- They must inform customers that received historic location data within the last three years of the requirement to delete, de-identify, or render the data non-sensitive.
- The companies must maintain a supplier assessment program to ensure that consumer consent has been given for collection of location data.
- The companies are banned from misrepresenting the extent to which they review supplier compliance and consent frameworks, consumer disclosures, and sample notices.
- Each violation of a final consent order may result in a civil penalty of up to $51,744.
