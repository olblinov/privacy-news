# Summary

In 2020, the Dutch Data Protection Authority (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens, or AP) fined Coolblue €40,000 for unlawfully processing personal data through cookies. The company collected personal data from website visitors without their explicit consent, assuming consent based on their visit and pre-checking consent boxes, which violates the General Data Protection Regulation (AVG). This action was taken after the AP investigated Coolblue's cookie policy and found it non-compliant. The AP has been increasing its scrutiny of cookie usage, providing guidance and running public awareness campaigns about the privacy risks of cookies.

# Details

## Background

The AP initiated an investigation into websites, including Coolblue.nl, in late 2019 to check compliance with cookie regulations. After an initial visit, the AP notified Coolblue in November 2019 about its non-compliant cookie policy. Subsequent checks in April and May 2020 revealed that Coolblue had not corrected its practices, which led to a formal investigation. By June 2020, Coolblue had adjusted its practices. The AP has been actively checking websites for cookie compliance since 2024, especially focusing on misleading cookie banners and is also providing public guidance on how to use cookies correctly. The AP has also started a campaign to raise awareness about the impact of cookies on privacy and encourage organizations to review their cookie policies.

## Legal Analysis

Under the AVG, organizations must obtain explicit consent before using cookies to collect personal data. This means users must actively choose to allow cookies. **Coolblue violated this by assuming consent and pre-selecting consent options**. The AP emphasizes that cookie banners must clearly explain how and why personal data is collected and provide users with the ability to refuse cookies without negative consequences. Cookie walls, which deny website access if cookies are not accepted, are generally not allowed because they do not provide a free choice to users. Furthermore, cookie banners should not use "dark patterns" to trick users into accepting cookies by making it more difficult to refuse cookies than to accept. #dark_pattern The AP has outlined nine key aspects for a clear cookie banner to help organizations comply with the law:

- Provide clear information about the purpose of the cookies.
- Do not pre-select consent options.
- Use clear language on buttons (e.g., "accept" or "reject").
- Ensure both acceptance and rejection options are equally accessible on the first layer of the banner.
- Make sure the option to reject cookies is visible and accessible.
- Do not require additional clicks to reject cookies.
- Avoid using inconspicuous links for the reject option.
- Clearly explain how users can withdraw their consent.
- Do not confuse consent with legitimate interest.

The processing of personal data through cookies usually requires the user's consent, except for functional and limited analytical cookies where the basis of legitimate interest may apply. It's crucial for organizations to provide clear information on data processing, even when consent is not required.

## Sanction

Coolblue received a fine of €40,000 for its unlawful processing of personal data via cookies. The AP actively enforces cookie regulations and can take action against organizations that do not comply. **This case highlights the AP's increased focus on ensuring organizations properly request consent for cookies and avoid misleading practices**.
