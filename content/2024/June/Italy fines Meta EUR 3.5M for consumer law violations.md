In the Instagram registration process, users have not received clear information on the collection and use of their data for commercial purposes. The Authority has ascertained that Meta, in violation of articles 20, 21 and 22 of the Consumer Code, has not immediately informed users registered on Instagram via the web of the use of their personal data for commercial purposes. In addition, the Authority has ascertained that, in violation of article 20 of the Consumer Code, Meta has not precisely managed the suspension of its users' Facebook and Instagram accounts. In particular, Meta did not indicate how it decides to suspend Facebook accounts (if following an automated or human review) and did not provide Facebook and Instagram users with information on the possibility of contesting the suspension of their accounts (they can contact an out-of-court dispute resolution body or a judge).
