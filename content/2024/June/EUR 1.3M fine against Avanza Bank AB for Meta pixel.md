# Summary
The bank used a so-called Meta pixel on its website and app and which meant that information about, for example, customers' securities holdings and account numbers was transferred to Meta. Avanza has used Meta's analysis tool Facebook pixel (now the Meta pixel) both on its website and in its app in order to optimize the bank's marketing on Facebook. The incorrect transfer of personal data was caused by the bank accidentally activating new sub-functions in the Meta pixel.
