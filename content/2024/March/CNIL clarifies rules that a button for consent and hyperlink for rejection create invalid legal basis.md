FORIOU carries out phone prospecting campaigns in order to promote the loyalty programs and cards it markets. Data of solicited prospects are purchased by the company from data brokers and publishers of competition and product testing websites. CNIL regarded that misleading appearance of the data collection forms used by data brokers responsible for collecting the data did not allow valid consent to be obtained from the individuals concerned. The prominence given to the buttons requiring users to transmit their data for commercial prospecting purposes (by their size, colour, title and location), compared with the hypertext links enabling users to take part in the game without accepting this transmission (of a much smaller size and blending in with the body of the text), strongly encourages users to accept. See screenshots at  for more illustrations. The company was fined 1% of its turnover or EUR 310k.
