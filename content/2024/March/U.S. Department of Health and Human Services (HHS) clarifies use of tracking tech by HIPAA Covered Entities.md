NB: A court vacated the guidance to the extent it provides that HIPAA obligations are triggered in “circumstances where an online technology connects (1) an individual’s IP address with (2) a visit to an unauthenticated public webpage addressing specific health conditions or healthcare providers.

  - **What is a tracking technology?** Script or code on a website or mobile app used to gather information about users or their actions as they interact with a website or mobile app. After information is collected through tracking technologies from websites or mobile apps, it is then analyzed by owners of the website or mobile app (“website owner” or “mobile app owner”), or third parties, to create insights about users’ online activities. Websites commonly use tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons or tracking pixels, session replay scripts, and fingerprinting scripts to track and collect information from users. Mobile apps generally include/embed tracking code within the app to enable the app to collect information directly provided by the user, and apps may also capture the user’s mobile device-related information.
  - **How do the HIPAA Rules apply to regulated entities’ use of tracking technologies?** Some regulated entities may be disclosing a variety of information to tracking technology vendors through tracking technologies placed on the regulated entity’s website or mobile app, such as information that the individual types or selects when they use regulated entities’ websites or mobile apps. The information disclosed might include an individual’s medical record number, home or email address, or dates of appointments, as well as an individual’s IP address or geographic location, device IDs, or any unique identifying code. In some cases, the information disclosed may meet the definition of individually identifiable health information (IIHI). 
    - !!! The **mere fact that an online tracking technology connects the IP address** of a user’s device (or other identifying information) **with a visit to a webpage addressing specific health conditions** or listing health care providers **is not a sufficient combination of information to constitute IIHI if the visit to the webpage is not related to an individual’s past, present, or future health, health care, or payment** for health care.
    - **Tracking on user-authenticated webpages**: Tracking technologies on a regulated entity’s user-authenticated webpages generally have access to PHI. Such PHI may include, for example, an individual’s IP address, medical record number, home or email addresses, dates of appointments, or other identifying information that the individual may provide when interacting with the webpage. #sensitive Tracking technologies within user-authenticated webpages may even have access to an individual’s diagnosis and treatment information, prescription information, billing information, or other information within the portal. Therefore, a regulated entity must configure any user-authenticated webpages that include tracking technologies to allow such technologies to only use and disclose PHI in compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
    - **Tracking on unauthenticated webpages**: Tracking technologies on many unauthenticated webpages do not have access to individuals’ PHI; in this case, a regulated entity’s use of such tracking technologies is not regulated by the HIPAA Rules.
      - For example, where a user merely visits a hospital’s webpage that provides information about the hospital’s job postings or visiting hours, the collection and transmission of information showing such a visit to the webpage, along with the user’s IP address, geographic location, or other identifying information showing their visit to that webpage, would not involve a disclosure of an individual’s PHI to  tracking technology vendor.
      - For example, if a student were writing a term paper on the changes in the availability of oncology services before and after the COVID-19 public health emergency, the collection and transmission of information showing that the student visited a hospital’s webpage listing the oncology services provided by the hospital would not constitute a disclosure of PHI, even if the information could be used to identify the student.
      - For example, tracking technologies might collect an individual’s email address, or reason for seeking health care typed or selected by an individual, when the individual visits a regulated entity’s webpage and makes an appointment with a health care provider or enters symptoms in an online tool to obtain a health analysis. In this example, the regulated entity is disclosing PHI to the tracking technology vendor, and **thus the HIPAA Rules apply**. 
    - **Tracking within mobile apps**: Mobile apps that regulated entities offer to individuals (e.g., to help manage their health information, pay bills) collect a variety of information provided by the app user, including information typed or uploaded into the app, as well as information provided by the app user’s device, such as fingerprints,32 network location, geolocation, device ID, or advertising ID. Such information collected by a regulated entity’s mobile app generally is PHI and the regulated entity must comply with the HIPAA Rules for any PHI that the mobile app uses or discloses, including any subsequent disclosures to the mobile app vendor, tracking technology vendor, or any other third party who receives such information.
  - **HIPAA compliance obligations for regulated entities when using tracking technologies**:
    - Ensuring that all disclosures of PHI to tracking technology vendors are specifically permitted by the Privacy Rule
      - the Privacy Rule does not permit disclosures of PHI to a tracking technology vendor based solely on a regulated entity informing individuals in its privacy policy, notice, or terms and conditions of use that it plans to make such disclosures. Regulated entities must ensure that all tracking technology vendors have signed a BAA and that there is an applicable permission prior to a disclosure of PHI;
      - Website banners that ask users to accept or reject a website’s use of tracking technologies, such as cookies, do not constitute a valid HIPAA authorization.
    - Establishing a BAA with a tracking technology vendor that meets the definition of a “business associate.”
    - Addressing the use of tracking technologies in the regulated entity’s Risk Analysis and Risk Management processes
    - Providing breach notification to affected individuals
