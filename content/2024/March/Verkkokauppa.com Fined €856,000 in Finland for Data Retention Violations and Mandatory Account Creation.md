# Summary

The Finnish Data Protection Authority (Tietosuojavaltuutetun toimisto) has imposed an €856,000 fine on Verkkokauppa.com for violating data protection regulations. The company required customers to create an account to make online purchases and stored customer data for an undefined period, which is against data protection laws. The Data Protection Authority has ordered the company to define a specific retention period for customer data and cease the practice of mandatory account creation.

# Details

## Background

- A customer complaint led to an investigation of Verkkokauppa.com's practices.
- Verkkokauppa.com required users to register an account to make online purchases, using a credit card.
- The company stated that the customer themselves defined the data retention period by deciding when to close their account.
- Verkkokauppa.com argued that requiring registration allowed them to identify customers, fulfill their accountability obligations, and allow customers to manage their rights.
- The company also claimed that data retention was necessary to fulfill its legal obligations, such as product liability and accounting laws.
- Verkkokauppa.com stated that creating an account was necessary for the company to provide all the functionalities of its platform, and that the customer relationship was ongoing.
- Verkkokauppa.com further argued that data processing was needed to fulfill contracts, and the customer account was part of the contract.
- Verkkokauppa.com also argued that customers were aware of data processing, as they accepted the terms of service and privacy policy when creating an account.
- **However, the Data Protection Authority found that Verkkokauppa.com collected and stored personal data beyond what was necessary for a single transaction, since purchasing from the online store was impossible without creating an account, and the company retained customer data indefinitely unless the customer requested it to be deleted**.

## Legal Analysis

- The Data Protection Authority determined that **requiring an account for online purchases violated the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**. #minimization 
    - Specifically, the practice breached Article 5(1)(e) on storage limitation and Article 25(2) on data protection by default.
    - According to the GDPR, personal data should only be stored as long as is necessary for the purpose of processing it.
- The authority also found that the company had failed to define a specific retention period for customer data. #retention 
    - Relying on a customer's action to close the account to trigger data deletion was not compliant with GDPR, and it placed the responsibility for data protection on the customer.
- The Data Protection Authority rejected Verkkokauppa.com's arguments:
    - **The argument that creating an account was necessary for customer identification and accountability was rejected, because those requirements do not justify the mandatory creation of an account**. #minimization 
    - **The argument that data retention was needed for warranty and product liability reasons was also dismissed, because these can be managed without retaining the customer's data**. #retention 
    - The argument that the data retention time was determined by the customer's active customer relationship was also rejected.
    - The argument that the company was within its rights to define its business model was deemed irrelevant if the business model violated the GDPR.
- The Data Protection Authority clarified that data processing must be limited to the extent necessary for the transaction.
- **The Authority noted that data retention should be limited to the minimum necessary and that giving the customer the option to delete their data does not exempt the company from its responsibility**.
- The Authority also emphasized that the customer should have the widest possible control over their personal data.
- The company also failed to demonstrate a valid legal basis for processing data related to mandatory account creation.
- The Data Protection Authority found that **the company knowingly decided not to set a data retention period, and therefore consciously violated the law**.

## Sanction

- Verkkokauppa.com was fined **€856,000** for failing to define a retention period for customer data.
    - The fine was calculated based on the company's turnover.
- The company was ordered to:
    - Define a specific and appropriate retention period for customer data.
    - Correct the practice of mandatory registration for online purchases.
    - Delete or anonymize customer data that has been stored for longer than the defined retention period.
    - The company also received a reprimand for violating data protection regulations.
- The decision is not yet final, as Verkkokauppa.com has announced its intention to appeal.
- **The Authority did not issue a fine for requiring mandatory registration to make a purchase, but has stated that it will be issuing fines for this practice in the future**. #minimization
