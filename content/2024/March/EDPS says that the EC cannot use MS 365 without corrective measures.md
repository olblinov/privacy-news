In EDPS's opinion, the EC failed to comply with GDPR on the following matters: 
  - Purpose limitation:
    - failure to sufficiently determine the types of personal data collected;
    - failure to ensure that the purposes for which Microsoft is permitted to collect personal data are specified and explicit;
    - failure to ensure that Microsoft processes personal data to provide its services only on documented instructions from the Commission;
    - failure to assess whether the purposes for further processing are compatible with the purposes for which the personal data have initially been collected;
    - failure to assess whether it is necessary and proportionate to transmit the personal data to Microsoft Ireland and its sub-processors (including affiliates) located in the EEA for a specific purpose in the public interest;
  - Transfers outside of EU/EEA:
    - failure to clearly provide in the 2021 ILA what types of personal data can be transferred to which recipients in which third country and for which purposes, and to give Microsoft documented instructions in that regard;
    - has not appraised, either prior to the initiation of the transfers or subsequently, what personal data will be transferred to which recipients in which third countries and for which purposes, thereby not obtaining the minimum information necessary to determine whether any supplementary measures are required to ensure the essentially equivalent 5 level of protection and whether any effective supplementary measures exist and could be implemented;
    - had not implemented effective supplementary measures for transfers to the United States taking place prior to the entry into force of the US adequacy decision, in light of the Schrems II judgment, nor has it demonstrated that such measures existed;
    - concluding the Standard contractual clauses (“SCCs”) for transfers from the Commission to Microsoft Corporation without having clearly mapped the proposed transfers, concluded a transfer impact assessment and included appropriate safeguards in those SCCs.
