Member State may order of its own motion, namely even in the absence of a prior request made by the data subject to that effect, the erasure of unlawfully processed data if such a measure is necessary in order to fulfil its responsibility for ensuring that the GDPR is fully enforced. If that authority finds that the treatment of data does not comply with the GDPR, it must remedy the infringement found, even without a prior request from the data subject.
