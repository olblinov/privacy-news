- **TikTok fined £1.875 million for inaccurate response to UK's Ofcom on matter of parental controls** ( ): Ofcom asked TikTok to provide data on take-up of its parental controls feature, “Family Pairing”. TikTok responded to our information request on 4 September 2023. On 1 December 2023, TikTok highlighted that the data it had provided was not accurate and that it was conducting an internal investigation to understand the root cause of its inaccuracies. Despite being aware that we intended to include its parental controls data in an imminent transparency report, TikTok did not inform Ofcom about the inaccuracy for more than three weeks after discovering the issue.
