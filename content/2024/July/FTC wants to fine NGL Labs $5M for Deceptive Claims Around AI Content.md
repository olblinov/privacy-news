- **FTC wants to fine NGL Labs $5M for Deceptive Claims Around AI Content** (  [complaint transcript](ngl_complaint_transcribed.md)):
  - Background: Defendants develop and operate a social media app (“NGL App”) that
    can be installed on Apple and Android devices. The NGL App purports to allow
    consumers to receive anonymous messages from their friends and social media
    contacts. The NGL App purports to allow consumers to receive anonymous
    messages from their friends and social media contacts. Defendants have described
    the NGL App as a “fresh take on anonymity” that provides a “safe space for
    teens.”
  - Findings:
    - FTC and Los Angeles DA’s Office allege that NGL and its co-founders not only actively marketed their service to children and teens, but that they also **falsely claimed that its AI content moderation program filtered out cyberbullying** and other harmful messages.
    - In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants sent **fake messages that appeared to come from real people and tricked users into signing up for their paid subscription** by falsely promising that doing so would reveal the identity of the senders of messages.
      - When a consumer posted a prompt inviting anonymous messages, they would receive computer-generated fake messages such as “are you straight?” or “I know what you did.” NGL used fake, computer-generated messages like these or others—such as messages regarding stalking—in an effort to trick consumers into believing that their friends and social media contacts were engaging with them through the NGL App. #enforcement_pattern
      - When a user would receive a reply to a prompt—whether it was from a real consumer or a fake message—consumers saw advertising encouraging them to buy the NGL Pro service to find out the identity of the sender. The complaint alleges, however, that consumers who signed up for the service, which cost as much as $9.99 a week, did not receive the name of the sender. Instead, paying users only received useless “hints” such as the time the message was sent, whether the sender had an Android or iPhone device, and the sender’s general location. NGL’s bait-and-switch tactic prompted many consumers to complain, which NGL executives laughed off, dismissing such users as “suckers.”
  - Result:
    - USD 5M fine;
    - Obligation to implement a neutral age gate that prevents new and current users from accessing the app if they indicate that they are under 18;
    - Prohibited from making misrepresentations about the sender of messages on any app and making similar false claims as outlined in the complaint;
    - Prohibited from making misrepresentations about the capabilities of any artificial intelligence technology, and its ability to filter out cyberbullying;
    - Prohibited from making misrepresentations related to negative options and required to disclose all details related to recurring charges; and
    - Required to obtain express informed consent from consumers prior to billing them for a negative option subscription, provide a simple mechanism for cancelling any negative option subscriptions, and to send reminders to consumers about negative option charges.
