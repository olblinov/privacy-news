- **Vinted fined €2.38M for shadow-blocking users** 
  - Background: Vinted, UAB (the company) is the operator of the online second-hand clothing trading and exchange platform “Vinted”.
  - Findings:
    - The company, in its response to the applicants’ requests, indicated that it would not act on a specific request for deletion of data, because the applicant concerned did not identify in their request the ‘specific grounds’ under Article 17 of the GDPR, i.e. they did not identify a specific reason corresponding to Article 17(1) of the GDPR. #rights 
    - The company, in order to ensure the security of the platform and its users, unlawfully applied ‘shadow blocking’ (the processing of personal data with the intention that a person who allegedly violates the “Vinted” platform’s principles of operation should leave the platform without being aware of such processing of their personal data) in respect of some of the applicants, in violation of the principles of fairness and transparency. #change 
    - The company did not take sufficient technical and organisational measures to ensure the implementation of the principle of accountability and to be able to demonstrate that it had taken (or reasonably refused to take) action with regard to right of access.
  - Result: administrative fine of EUR 2 385 276.
