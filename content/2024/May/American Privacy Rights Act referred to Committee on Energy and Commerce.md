 The US is planning to adopt a federal privacy law (the “American Privacy Rights Act“) which will (1) replace state laws; and (2) bring the regulation much closer to EU’s GDPR level of protections. The law is far from adoption, but signifies a movement in the US to increase its standards up to GDPR’s level in terms of user rights, security, minimizing scope of data collected etc.
