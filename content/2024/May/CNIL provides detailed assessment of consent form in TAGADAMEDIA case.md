 TAGADAMEDIA collects data from prospects through forms it offers on its websites to participate in competitions or product testing. This data is then sent to the company's partners for commercial prospecting. During the investigations, the company provided the CNIL with two examples of forms for collecting data from prospective customers, such as those shown below. However, the presentation of these forms did not allow free, informed and unambiguous consent to be obtained. In fact, the highlighting of the button allowing users to give their consent in contrast to that of the button allowing users not to give their consent, or the incomplete text and reduced size, strongly encouraged users to agree to the transmission of their data to partners. #change

  - The company submitted the CNIL a new form during the sanction procedure, corresponding to the example below. The consent obtained via this new form still did not allow to obtain a valid consent, thereby depriving the processing operation of any legal basis. ![image2](https://www.cnil.fr/sites/cnil/files/2024-01/tagadamedia_form_example_investigations_1.png)
