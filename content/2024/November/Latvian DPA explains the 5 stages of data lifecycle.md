# Summary

The provided text explains the data processing lifecycle using a fictional company, SIA "Datiņš," as an example. The lifecycle is divided into five phases: data acquisition, distribution, utilization, maintenance, and deletion. It highlights the importance of data protection principles at each stage and emphasizes that businesses must consider data security and compliance with data protection laws throughout the entire process.

# Details

- **Data Lifecycle Model**: The data lifecycle is presented as a model to determine the legality of data processing and applicable security measures throughout the entire process. The model can be visualized to better understand the data flow and to ensure no processing element is overlooked.
- **Five Phases**: The data lifecycle consists of five phases:
    - **Data Acquisition**: This is the initial phase where data is collected from various sources, including directly from clients, external databases, or generated by the company itself. In the example, SIA "Datiņš" acquires customer email addresses for sending out newsletters. The company gets explicit consent from clients for this data processing.
    - **Data Distribution**: This involves transferring the acquired data to a database, ensuring the data is accurate and the existing database's integrity is not compromised. Datiņš makes sure that only the newsletter subscription address is stored, and no additional information is added to the database.
    - **Data Utilization**: The data is used for its intended purpose, in this case, sending out newsletters. Access to the database is limited to the necessary personnel, and procedures are in place for users to unsubscribe from the newsletter. SIA "Datiņš" also monitors the database for unauthorized access.
    - **Data Maintenance**: During this phase, the company evaluates if the data is still accurate and if the processing is still lawful. This includes correcting inaccurate data and removing individuals who have unsubscribed from the newsletter. It also involves monitoring if the legal basis for data processing is still valid. Data may return to the acquisition phase if the goal is still achievable, otherwise, it moves to the final phase.
    - **Data Deletion**: This final phase involves deleting or anonymizing the data to ensure it is no longer considered personal data. Data is deleted when it is no longer needed, or when its use is no longer legally permissible. Data deletion must be irreversible, and any backups should be checked and dealt with accordingly. Non-digital data must be shredded or otherwise made unreadable.
- **SIA "Datiņš"**: The example company, "Datiņš," acts as the data controller and is responsible for ensuring data is processed in compliance with data protection principles. The company must ensure the data is protected and all the data processing is secure.
- **Importance of Planning**: The example demonstrates the importance of planning and performing a thorough analysis of the data protection lifecycle before initiating data processing. By preparing the lifecycle description, "Datiņš" saves time and ensures better control over the processes.
- **Security Measures**: Datiņš uses solutions with active technical support and security updates. Data backups are made daily and stored separately.
- **Data Protection Principles**: The data processing lifecycle model is used to check for compliance with data protection principles at each phase.
- **Practical Application**: The lifecycle analysis helps reveal shortcomings in data processing, weak security points, and areas that may have been overlooked.
- **Data Definition**: The source defines data processing as any operation performed on personal data, including collection, storage, use, and deletion.
