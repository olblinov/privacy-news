# Summary

This document details a **sector-wide investigation** conducted by the Hamburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (HmbBfDI) into credit collection services. The investigation, which included questionnaires, document reviews, and on-site visits, aimed to assess how these companies handle debtors' data. While most companies demonstrated professionalism, one was fined **900,000 euros** for unlawfully storing personal data for up to five years after the legal retention period had expired. This case underscores the importance of adhering to deletion obligations under the GDPR.

# Detail

## Factual Background

The Hamburg DPA conducted a targeted audit of credit collection services, a sector where Hamburg is a leading European location. The investigation was prompted by the fact that the data processed by these companies, relating to debtors, is particularly sensitive. The data is regularly shared with credit reference agencies and address investigation services. The audit aimed to ensure the responsible handling of this data by the companies. The audit involved:

- Sending detailed **questionnaires** to the companies.
- Requesting documents, such as **processing activity directories, security measure lists, and sample letters**.
- Conducting **on-site visits** to some of the companies after a preliminary review of the written materials. The investigation was conducted independently of individual complaints. The HmbBfDI reported that it observed a high level of professionalism and sensitivity in the majority of the companies.

## Violation

One company was found to have violated Articles 5(1)(a) and 6(1) of the GDPR. Despite having long passed the legal deletion deadlines, the company continued to store a six-digit number of personal data records. This data was stored without any legal basis. The data was held for up to five years after the expiration of the legal retention period. The originally processed data was not shared with third parties during this extended storage period, but it remained in the company's database. The company had not developed a coherent deletion policy.

## Sanction

The Hamburg DPA imposed a fine of **900,000 euros** on the company for the violation. The company admitted the violation and accepted the fine. The company cooperated professionally with the supervisory authority in the follow-up, which contributed to the fine being comparatively lower. The fine was a legally binding decision. A similar violation was found at another company, and the related procedure is ongoing.
