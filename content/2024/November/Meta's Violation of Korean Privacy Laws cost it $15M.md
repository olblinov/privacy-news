# Summary

The Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC) of South Korea has imposed a fine of 21.6 billion won (approx USD 15M) on Meta for collecting and using sensitive personal information without proper consent. Meta collected sensitive information such as religious and political views from approximately 980,000 Korean users. The PIPC also found that Meta failed to take proper safety measures and denied user requests to access their personal information. Meta was ordered to take corrective action to comply with the Personal Information Protection Act.

# Detail

## Factual Background

- The PIPC initiated an investigation into Meta after recognizing the company's collection and use of sensitive personal information without consent.
- Meta collected sensitive personal information, including religious and political views, and marital status, of approximately 980,000 domestic users through their Facebook profiles.
- Meta analyzed user behavior, such as "likes" and clicked ads, to create advertising themes related to sensitive topics like religion, homosexuality, and North Korean defectors.
- This information was provided to around 4,000 advertisers.
- Meta did not obtain separate consent for collecting and using this data, instead only including it in its Data Policy in an unclear manner.

## Violation

- **Collection of Sensitive Information:** Meta collected sensitive information without explicit consent, violating the Personal Information Protection Act. The Act strictly protects information such as thoughts, beliefs, political views, and sexual orientation, allowing processing only with explicit consent.
- **Denial of Access Requests:** Meta denied user requests to access their personal information, including the duration of processing, third-party sharing, and consent details, citing that these were not subject to access requests under the law. However, the enforcement ordinance of the Protection Act defines these as subject to access requests, and Meta's denial was deemed without cause by the PIPC.
- **Security Breach:** Meta did not remove an unused account recovery page, which allowed hackers to submit fake IDs, reset passwords, and leak the personal information of 10 Korean users.

## Sanction

- **Fines and Penalties:** Meta was fined 21,623,200,000 won for violations of the Protection Act.
- **Corrective Measures:** The PIPC ordered Meta to secure legal grounds for processing sensitive information, implement safety measures, and respond truthfully to users' personal information access requests.
- **Ongoing Monitoring:** The PIPC will continue to monitor Meta's implementation of corrective actions.
- **Importance of Compliance:** The PIPC emphasized that global service providers are obliged to comply with the Protection Act, and that the rights of data subjects should be guaranteed, highlighting the importance of protecting personal information.
