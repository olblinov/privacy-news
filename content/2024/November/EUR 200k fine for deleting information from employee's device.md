# Summary

The Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) initiated a sanction procedure against Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A. (BBVA) after a former employee reported that the bank remotely wiped the data on a personal cell phone that the employee had purchased from the bank after terminating employment. The AEPD determined that the bank violated Article 6.1 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by deleting personal data from the device without a legal basis. BBVA acknowledged responsibility by paying a reduced fine of 120,000 euros, which terminated the sanction procedure.

# Detail

## Factual Background

- A former employee of BBVA, referred to as DÃ±a. A.A.A., filed a complaint with the AEPD on February 13, 2023.
- The employee had purchased their corporate mobile phone for personal use after leaving the company in September 2021.
- On June 23, 2022, the phone was remotely locked by BBVA, requiring corporate credentials to access it.
- BBVA directed the former employee to reset the phone to factory settings, resulting in the loss of all personal data. BBVA admitted that the phone should have been wiped before the employee purchased it, but this was not done.
- The employee's personal data was deleted after the device was enrolled in the bank's corporate device management platform for over nine months.
- The bank stated that the employee was terminated in April 2022, and that the data wipe occurred in June 2022.
- The bank stated that as part of the Corporate Smartphone Project, it was authorized to delete data from devices when employees left the company, but admitted that the device should have been cleared of corporate data before being sold to the employee.
- BBVA's Corporate Smartphone Project indicated that after a 24-month period, employees could choose to purchase the device, at which point the device should no longer be considered a work tool and the bank should remove all pre-installed corporate applications, restrictions, and configurations.

## Violation

- The AEPD determined that BBVA violated Article 6.1 of the GDPR, which requires a legal basis for processing personal data.
- The bank did not have a legitimate reason to delete the personal data on the former employee's phone as there was no legal basis for the treatment carried out.
- While BBVA had the right to remove corporate applications from the device, its policy did not authorize the deletion of personal data.
- The AEPD noted that the bank's action resulted in the loss of the employee's personal information and control over their data.
- The AEPD considered the bank's actions a severe breach of data protection principles and noted that the bank was negligent in not following its own procedures.

## Sanction

- The AEPD initially proposed a fine of 200,000 euros for the violation.
- The agency considered the nature, severity, and duration of the infringement, as well as the bank's negligence, in setting the fine.
- BBVA was informed that they could reduce the fine to 160,000 euros by acknowledging responsibility and to 120,000 euros by also making a voluntary payment.
- BBVA paid the reduced fine of 120,000 euros, acknowledging their responsibility, which resulted in the termination of the sanction procedure.
- The payment of the reduced fine required the bank to waive any right to appeal the sanction.
- The AEPD declared the termination of the sanction procedure against BBVA on the basis of the voluntary payment.
