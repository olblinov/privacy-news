# Summary

Meta is introducing changes to its Facebook and Instagram platforms in the EU, offering users a choice between a paid subscription for an ad-free experience, continuing to use the services for free with personalized ads, or opting for a free service with less personalized ads. This change comes in response to demands from EU regulators regarding user data and advertising practices. The less personalized ads option uses significantly less user data, relying instead on context and basic information such as age, gender, and location. The aim is to provide users with greater control over their data and ad experience, though it may result in ads that are less relevant to their interests.

# Detail

## Factual Background

- **Regulatory Pressure:** Meta has been facing increasing pressure from EU regulators regarding its data processing and advertising practices.
- **"Consent or Pay" Model:** Initially, Meta offered users a choice between consenting to personalized ads or paying for an ad-free experience. This model was criticized for not providing users with a genuinely free choice.
- **GDPR and DMA:** The changes are being made in response to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA), as well as related regulatory interpretations.
- **Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU):** The CJEU has endorsed the subscription model as a way for people to consent to data processing for personalized advertising.
- **Subscription Price Reduction:** Meta has significantly reduced the price of its monthly subscription for an ad-free experience. It has been reduced from €9.99 to €5.99 per month on the web, and from €12.99 to €7.99 per month on iOS and Android. Additional accounts are charged at €4/month on the web and €5/month on iOS and Android.
- **Less Personalized Ads:** Users will be able to choose to see less personalized ads, which will rely on less data. These ads will be based on context, such as the content a user is currently viewing, and a minimal set of data points.
- **Ad Breaks:** Meta will introduce ad breaks in the less personalized ads experience to allow advertisers to connect with a wider audience. These ads will be unskippable for a few seconds.

## Result

- **User Choice:** Users in the EU, EEA, and Switzerland now have three options: a paid subscription for an ad-free experience, free access with personalized ads, or free access with less personalized ads.
- **Data Control:** Users gain more control over their data and ad experience by opting for less personalized ads.
- **Reduced Ad Relevance:** The less personalized ads may be less relevant to a user’s interests due to the reduced data used.
- **Economic Impact:** Meta states that personalized ads are beneficial for businesses, particularly small businesses, driving revenue and supporting jobs.
- **Continued Personalized Advertising:** Meta remains committed to personalized advertising and believes that most people will choose this option.
- **Commitment to Compliance:** Meta emphasizes that these changes go beyond what is legally required, demonstrating their commitment to complying with EU regulations.
- **Ongoing Evaluation:** Regulatory authorities will continue to assess whether Meta's changes fully address concerns about freedom of choice and privacy.
- **Notification:** Users will be notified about the new less personalized ads option and can make or change their choice at any time through their ad settings.
