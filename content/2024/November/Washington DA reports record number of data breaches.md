# Summary

The Washington State Attorney General's office released its ninth annual data breach report, revealing a record high of over **11.6 million data breach notices** sent to Washingtonians in the past year. This number exceeds the state's population, indicating many individuals were affected by multiple breaches. Cyberattacks, particularly ransomware, were the most common cause, accounting for 78% of reported breaches. The report includes recommendations for policymakers to strengthen data breach notification laws, increase transparency from data brokers and collectors, and consult with tribes on cybersecurity.

# Detail

- **Data Breach Statistics:**
    - The number of data breach notices sent to Washingtonians in 2024 was 11.6 million. This is the highest number since the Attorney General's office began tracking data breaches.
    - The number of notices is significantly higher than the previous all-time high of 6.5 million in 2021.
    - The number of breaches impacting at least 500 Washingtonians was 279 in 2024. This is the second-highest number recorded since 2016.
    - There were two "mega breaches" (affecting over a million Washingtonians each) in 2024, at Comcast and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. This is the first time more than one mega breach has occurred in a single year.
    - The total number of Washingtonians affected increased 158% from the previous year.
- **Causes of Data Breaches:**
    - Cyberattacks were the most common cause of breaches, accounting for 78% of all reported breaches.
    - Ransomware attacks were the most common type of cyberattack, representing 52% of all cyberattacks.
    - Ransomware attacks have been the most common type of cyberattack for the past four years.
    - Other causes of data breaches include theft or mistake and unauthorized access.
    - Cyberattacks can occur through malware, phishing, and skimmers.
- **Types of Personal Information Compromised:**
    - Social Security numbers (SSNs) were compromised in 69.5% of all breaches.
    - Full dates of birth were the most commonly compromised pieces of personal information for the second time in the last four years.
    - Other types of personal information include driver's license numbers, account numbers, credit or debit card numbers, student/military/passport ID numbers, health insurance information, medical information, biometric data, usernames and passwords.
- **Recommendations for Policymakers:**
    - Reduce the data breach notification deadline to three days.
    - Create language access requirements for data breach notifications.
    - Expand the definition of "personal information" to include full names in combination with a redacted SSN (last four digits) and Individual Tax Identification Numbers (ITINs).
    - Require businesses to recognize and honor opt-out preference signals.
    - Require transparency from data brokers and collectors through annual reporting, state licensing, and regulatory fees.
    - Consult with tribes on how best to support their efforts in combating cyberattacks.
- **Past Reforms**
    - In 2019, legislation was passed to strengthen Washington's data breach notification law, expanding the definition of personal information, requiring notices to include the period of time data was at risk, and shortening the notification timeline to 30 days after the discovery of a breach.
    - In 2023, the My Health My Data Act was passed, to provide more control over health data and protect individuals seeking reproductive and gender-affirming care.
- **Impact of Data Breaches and Notification Timeframes**
    - A 2011 study suggests that losses are 21% lower when consumers detect identity theft within the first week, and 65% lower when detected within a year.
    - A 2006 survey found that 30% of consumers who discovered their personal information was misused after 6 months had to spend $1,000 or more in losses.
    - A 2018 survey suggests that consumers' emotional distress doubles after spending more than one day working to resolve identity theft.
- **Resources for Individuals and Businesses:**
    - Individuals are advised to place fraud alerts and security freezes on their credit reports.
    - Individuals can monitor their financial accounts, billing statements, and credit reports for suspicious activity.
- Individuals can report identity theft to the Federal Trade Commission at identitytheft.gov.
- Businesses are encouraged to understand their data security needs, minimize the amount of information they collect, and develop data security plans.
- The report provides links to various resources to help businesses understand and improve their data security.
- **Data Collection and Limitations:**
    - The report is based on data breach notifications received between July 24, 2023 and July 23, 2024.
    - The statistics in the report are point-in-time estimates, as data breaches can be complex and take time to resolve.
    - The "Number of Washingtonians Affected" is a sum of all data breach notices sent to Washingtonians, and may not reflect the exact number of individual Washingtonians impacted.
    - The Attorney General's Office uses a standardized online web form for breached organizations to provide notice.
