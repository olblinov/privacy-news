# Summary

**Integrated data protection**, also known as "data protection by design," is an approach that ensures lawful and secure personal data processing from the initial planning and development stages of a system, service, or process. This involves implementing technical and organizational measures throughout the entire processing lifecycle to protect personal data, meet the requirements of the organization as a data controller, and safeguard the rights of individuals as data subjects. It means that privacy protection is built into information systems and infrastructure from the outset, anticipating and preventing potential privacy threats. This approach contrasts with "data protection by default" where technology is designed to process only the minimum necessary data, without requiring users to take specific actions to protect their privacy.

# Detail

Integrated data protection involves several key aspects:

- **Proactive Implementation**: Data protection measures are integrated into the planning and development phases of data processing, making them an essential part of the process. For example, a data processing system could have a built-in function to automatically delete personal data after the retention period expires.
- **Risk Assessment**: It emphasizes early risk assessment and prevention, rather than addressing issues after they have occurred. For example, security checks such as penetration testing should be performed before the system is used to identify and prevent data breaches.
- **Technical and Organizational Measures**: Both technical and organizational measures are used to ensure compliance with data protection requirements. Examples include ensuring that software used for data processing is compliant and training staff on secure data processing practices.
- **Specific Measures** Measures to achieve integrated data protection can include data pseudonymization, giving data subjects control over their data processing, implementing malware detection systems, providing employee training on cyber hygiene, creating privacy and information security management systems, and establishing contractual obligations for processors.
- **Efficiency**: The efficiency of each implemented measure is key. Measures should be tailored to each specific processing activity, considering potential privacy risks.
- **Timing**: Data protection should be considered early on when planning new processing activities and determining the resources. However, data protection measures must also be maintained and regularly evaluated throughout the processing lifecycle to ensure their effectiveness.
- **Cost-effectiveness**: Incorporating data protection measures early is more cost-effective, as modifying established processing can be problematic and expensive.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** After processing begins, organizations must monitor and ensure that data protection measures are functioning as intended. They should also regularly re-evaluate their processing activities due to the evolving nature of risks, scale, and context.

**In summary,** the key is to proactively integrate data protection into every step of the data processing lifecycle, from the initial planning to the actual operation and maintenance of the system. This approach helps organizations achieve compliance and build trust with data subjects. The source material also provides a link to further reading on this topic.
