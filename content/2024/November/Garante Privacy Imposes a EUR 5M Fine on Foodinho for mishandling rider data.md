# Summary

The Italian data protection authority, **Garante per la protezione dei dati personali**, has fined Foodinho s.r.l., a food delivery company, €5,000,000 for multiple violations of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The violations include inadequate data processing, lack of transparency, and insufficient protection of rider data, including the use of an algorithm without human oversight. The investigation was initiated following the death of a rider in 2022, and revealed that the company had failed to implement necessary data protection measures despite a prior warning.

# Detail

## Factual Background

- The investigation was initiated after a rider, Sebastian Galassi, died in a road accident in Florence in 2022 while making a delivery for Foodinho s.r.l..
- The Garante delegated the investigation to the Special Unit for the Protection of Privacy and Technological Fraud of the Guardia di Finanza.
- Inspections were conducted on December 13-14, 2022, February 28-March 1, 2023, and July 26-27, 2023.
- The company uses the Glovo platform to manage rider activities, which includes a "Live Map" feature that displays rider locations, orders, and the distance between businesses and riders.
- The platform stores personal data and documents of riders with deactivated accounts from 2016.
- The company manually deactivated the rider's account after the accident to prevent unauthorized access, but an automatic message was sent to the rider stating that the account was deactivated for violating terms and conditions.
- The company monitors accounts through dashboards to detect potential misuse of the Glovo platform.
- The company uses an algorithm for assigning orders, taking into account factors such as pick-up and delivery points, mode of transport, distance, and rider's phone battery status.
- The company deactivated 6,369 rider accounts and blocked 53,861 in 2022.
- The company uses a "Grievance" process for account deactivations, with a notification to the rider, a six-day period for response, and a second notification of termination.
- The company provides a privacy policy within the collaboration contract and states that a broken link was the reason for the absence of a privacy policy on the access form.
- The company claimed that it was an error that riders were named as data controllers in the app, when in fact they are data processors.

## Violation

- **The company violated the principles of correctness, adequacy, relevance, and accuracy** in its data processing by sending a standard deactivation message to the deceased rider, even though the account deactivation was not due to a violation of terms and conditions.
- The company failed to adhere to **privacy by design and by default** principles.
- The company's **privacy policies and terms and conditions were unclear, incomplete, and inconsistent**.
- The company **did not provide adequate information about the data processing** related to chats and emails between riders and customer care.
- The company **did not accurately specify the legal basis and purpose for data processing**.
- The company **misrepresented the use of automated decision-making** and profiling.
- The company **failed to inform riders about the existence and functioning of fully automated systems** used for work management. #automated_decisions 
- The company **incorrectly designated riders as data controllers** instead of data processors.
- The company **failed to provide sufficient instructions to sub-processors** (call center operators) regarding the deactivation of accounts.
- The company **violated the principle of data minimization** by assigning a fictitious "rating" to riders in Italy and by sending rider data to third parties without sufficient control or oversight.
- The company **violated the rights of workers by using an algorithm to assign work without human oversight**, impacting the opportunities for work.
- The company **retained data longer than necessary**, including keeping data of deactivated riders since 2016 and phone records for 36 months. #retention 
- The company **failed to adequately assess the impact of data processing**, especially regarding automated systems and the use of biometric data.
- The company collected and processed biometric data without an adequate legal basis.
- The company **sent data to third parties (Google Firebase, Braze, and mParticle)** without ensuring the data was minimized and used for its intended purpose. #minimization
- The company violated Italian labor laws by **excluding riders from the platform and reducing work opportunities based on refusal to accept deliveries**, and also violated the rights of workers by using an algorithm to assign work without human oversight.
- The company **violated transparency rules** by not informing workers about the logic behind automated decision making systems.

## Sanction

- The Garante has **imposed a fine of €5,000,000** on Foodinho s.r.l..
- The company is **prohibited from further processing the biometric data** of riders and is required to delete the data already collected.
- The company is **required to reformulate the messages sent to riders regarding account deactivation** and/or blocking, to ensure that riders are informed of their right to contest the decision and request reinstatement.
- The company is required to **revise its privacy policies**, and ensure they are complete and consistent.
- The company is **required to comply with the requirements for data retention**.
- The company is **required to implement measures to protect the rights of workers** in relation to automated processing, including human oversight and contestation procedures.
- The company is **required to comply with labor laws** regarding the assignment of work.
- The company is **required to conform data transfers to third parties** with minimization principles.
- The company is **required to comply with Article 28 of the GDPR** with regard to data processing.
- The company is **required to comply with Article 4 of the Law 300/1970**, concerning the control of workers.
- The company is required to report the steps it has taken to comply with the order within 90 days.

The Garante emphasized the severity of the violations given that the company was previously sanctioned for similar issues.
