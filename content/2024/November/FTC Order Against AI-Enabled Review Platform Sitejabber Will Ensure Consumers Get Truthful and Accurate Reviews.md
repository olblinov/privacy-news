# Summary

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has filed a complaint against GGL Projects, Inc., also known as Sitejabber, for allegedly deceiving consumers by misrepresenting that the ratings and reviews on its platform came from customers who had actually experienced the reviewed products or services. Sitejabber collected feedback from customers at the point of purchase, before they had received their items, and then used this data to inflate the average ratings and review counts of its clients. The FTC alleges that this practice misled consumers into thinking that the high ratings reflected positive experiences with the products themselves, rather than just the shopping experience. Additionally, Sitejabber provided clients with tools to publish pre-fulfillment feedback on their own websites, further perpetuating the misrepresentation.

# Detail

## Factual Background

- **Sitejabber.com** is an AI-enabled review platform that hosts profiles for over 130,000 businesses. These profiles feature star ratings and customer reviews, which are often relied upon by consumers making purchasing decisions.
- Sitejabber offered its business clients tools to collect customer feedback, including "**Instant Feedback Surveys**" (IFS) and "**Instant Feedback Product Reviews**" (IFPR).
- **IFS** were presented to customers immediately after an online purchase, asking them to rate their "overall shopping experience so far".
- **IFPR** collected product-specific feedback at the point of sale, such as "Why did you choose the [product] today?".
- The feedback from these surveys was used to generate ratings and reviews on Sitejabber.com profiles.
- Sitejabber did not clearly disclose to consumers that many of the reviews and ratings were based on pre-fulfillment feedback. The company also did not clearly disclose what a "Solicited -Verified Website Experience" was, which referred to the point-of-sale reviews.
- The company touted the IFS as a way to capture customers at their happiest, generating positive feedback that would help clients achieve high scores on Sitejabber.

## Violation

- The FTC alleges that **Sitejabber misrepresented that ratings and reviews came from customers who had experienced the product or service** when, in fact, many or most were from customers who had not yet received their purchases.
- Sitejabber's use of point-of-sale reviews inflated the total review counts and average star ratings on business profiles. For example, one furniture retailer had an average rating of 4.72 stars based on 83,153 reviews, but over 98% of those reviews were from point-of-sale surveys. Without these reviews, its average rating would have been 2.19 stars.
- The inflated ratings and review counts were displayed on Sitejabber.com and in search results.
- By providing clients with product review tools, Sitejabber enabled them to publish pre-fulfillment feedback on their own websites as if they were reviews from customers who had received their orders.
- The FTC's complaint asserts that these practices constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act.

## Sanction

- Under a proposed order, Sitejabber is prohibited from misrepresenting that ratings or reviews are from customers who have actually received or experienced a product or service.
- The company is also barred from helping others make misrepresentations about any ratings or reviews.
- Sitejabber is prohibited from providing others with the means to misrepresent that point-of-sale ratings and reviews came from customers who had received or experienced the product or service purchased.
- The proposed order is subject to public comment for 30 days after it is published in the Federal Register, after which the Commission will decide whether to make it final.
- Each violation of the final order may result in a civil penalty of up to $51,744.
