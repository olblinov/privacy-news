# Summary

This document, a joint position paper by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), addresses how **online design practices can undermine consumer choice and control over personal information**. It highlights concerns that some common online design practices influence consumers' decisions in ways they may not be aware of or want. The paper focuses on specific harmful practices like **"harmful nudges and sludge," "confirmshaming," "biased framing," "bundled consent," and "default settings"**, explaining how these can lead to data protection, consumer, and competition harms. The document aims to provide clarity for firms and designers on how to comply with data protection laws and ensure fair competition, while also empowering users to make informed decisions about their personal data.

# Detail

## Factual Background

- Online interfaces and design choices are key touchpoints between firms and users in digital markets, and are referred to as Online Choice Architecture (OCA).
- OCA significantly influences consumer decisions on how firms collect, use, and share personal information, thus affecting user experiences and competition outcomes.
- While well-designed OCA can guide users towards beneficial choices, it can also be used to undermine users' control over their personal information.
- The ICO and CMA are concerned that certain design practices can make it difficult for consumers to make informed decisions.
- This paper specifically addresses OCA practices related to consumers' control over their personal information.
- The ICO and CMA expect firms to put the user at the heart of their design choices, empower user choice and control, test and trial design choices, and comply with relevant laws.
- The paper aims to provide practical examples of potentially harmful design practices and how they may infringe data protection, consumer, and competition laws.
- The document notes that consumers feel strongly about the misuse of their personal information, with 90% of people concerned about organizations using their data without permission.
- The ICO and CMA may take action against firms that continue to use concerning design practices.

## Violation

- **Harmful nudges and sludge**: These practices make it easier to make inadvertent or ill-considered decisions by creating excessive friction or by making one option much less cumbersome than another. This can lead to less privacy-enhancing choices and infringe the "fairness" and "transparency" principles of Article 5(1)(a) of the UK GDPR.
- **Confirmshaming**: This involves pressuring or shaming users into doing something, using language that suggests a "good" or "bad" choice. This is likely to infringe the “fairness” principle in Article 5(1)(a) of the UK GDPR, and any consent obtained this way is unlikely to be freely given.
- **Biased framing**: This practice presents choices in a way that emphasizes the supposed benefits of a particular option to make it more appealing, or emphasizes the supposed risks to discourage a user from selecting it. This can lead to ill-informed choices, infringing the "fairness" and "transparency" principles in Article 5(1)(a) of the UK GDPR.
- **Bundled consent**: This involves asking the user to consent to multiple separate purposes or processing activities with a single consent option. This makes it difficult for users to understand exactly what they are agreeing to and is unlikely to be "specific", potentially violating Article 4(11) of UK GDPR.
- **Default settings**: Firms apply a predefined choice that the user must take active steps to change, which can dissuade users from making a different choice. This can lead to less privacy-protective choices and may violate Article 25 of the UK GDPR, which requires a "data protection by design and default" approach.
- These practices can undermine consumers’ control over their personal information, leading to unwarranted intrusion, loss of control, and increased costs to avoid or mitigate harm. They also risk breaching consumer protection and competition laws by distorting choices and reinforcing market positions.

## Sanction

- The ICO may take formal regulatory action against firms that use concerning design practices that contravene data protection law.
- The CMA is already taking action to tackle misleading online practices, including through exercising its consumer enforcement powers.
- Firms that fail to meet expectations risk facing regulatory action and may be subject to enforcement measures to protect consumers and prevent harm.
- The document notes that where firms use OCA practices in ways that unfairly steer users towards decisions inconsistent with their privacy preferences, or that make it harder to exercise their rights, the ICO is likely to consider this an infringement of data protection law.
- The CMA will take into account any breach of data protection law when assessing the overall unfairness of commercial practices.
- The CMA is already acting to tackle misleading online practices and has taken action against firms in relation to the use of wider OCA practices.
- The ICO and CMA invite stakeholders to engage in further discussions and a workshop about good practices for the design of privacy choices online.
