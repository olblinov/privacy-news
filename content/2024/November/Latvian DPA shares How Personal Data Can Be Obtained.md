# Detail

## Factual Background

- The Data State Inspectorate of Latvia created this document to explain how personal data can be obtained, noting that a fitness club owner, Jānis Datiņš, sought clarification from a data protection specialist to ensure his data handling practices were compliant and transparent.
- Organizations may need to analyze and use various sources of personal data to achieve their operational goals, but such data collection must have a lawful basis and respect data processing principles.
- Organizations can obtain personal data directly from the individual, from third parties, or by observing individuals' activities.
- It is crucial for organizations to be transparent about where the data comes from and how it is used.
- Organizations must ensure they have a legal basis for the data collected and inform individuals about how their data is being processed.
- When data is collected directly from an individual, the organization must provide complete information about the planned data processing.
- Data can be obtained from other organizations if there is a legal basis, a legal requirement, a contractual relationship, or a legitimate interest.
- If the data is not collected directly from the individual, the organization receiving it must still inform the individual about the data processing, including the source and type of data.
- Exceptions to informing the individual exist when the person already knows about the data collection, if it is impossible or requires disproportionate effort, when it is prescribed by law, or to maintain confidentiality.
- Observed data is obtained through direct observation or measurements of actions or physical characteristics and can be used for targeted advertising or security purposes.
- Inferred data is derived from existing data through analysis, logic, or algorithms and can be used for predictions, assessments, or personalized offers.
