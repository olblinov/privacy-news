# Summary

The Autorité de protection des données (APD), the Belgian Data Protection Authority, has issued a decision against Freedelity, a company specializing in collecting and mutualizing customer data, for violations of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The APD found that Freedelity's methods for obtaining consent (including due to pressure to provide consent at the threat of missing out on financial benefits), its data minimization practices, and its data retention policies did not comply with the GDPR. As a result, the APD has ordered Freedelity to implement corrective measures within four months, under the threat of daily penalties for non-compliance.

# Detail

## Factual Background

- Freedelity is a Belgian company that offers technology to simplify the collection and updating of personal data, particularly through the use of the Belgian electronic identity card (eID).
- Freedelity partners with various businesses, including major retail chains, to collect and mutualize customer data.
- The APD initiated an investigation following an article in the "L’Echo" newspaper about Freedelity's data management practices.
- The investigation was conducted by the APD's Service d'Inspection, which identified several GDPR violations.
- The case was then brought before the APD's Chambre Contentieuse, which issued a final decision.
- The Chambre Contentieuse is the litigation chamber of the APD.

## Violation

- **Consent Issues**: The APD found that the consent mechanisms used by Freedelity and its partners did not meet the GDPR requirements for valid consent. Specifically, the consent was not:
    - **Free:** Consumers were often pressured to consent to data processing to receive benefits, with the consent for data sharing bundled with the acceptance of commercial advantages. For example, one of the retailers required the acceptance of Freedelity's terms and conditions to benefit from commercial advantages. #consent #change 
    - **Informed:** Consumers were not always clearly informed about the data processing, including the "mutualization of data." For example, some retailers did not mention data mutualization when requesting consent.
    - **Specific**: Consent was not obtained separately for each different purpose of data processing. The consent was often bundled with multiple purposes. For instance, one retailer obtained consent for three separate purposes with a single action.
    - **Unambiguous:** Consent was not expressed through a clear, affirmative action, such as a clear, explicit action and could not be inferred. Some retailers considered the insertion of an eID card into a reader as implied consent for multiple processing purposes.
    - **Revocable:** The process for consumers to withdraw their consent was not simple and easily accessible.
- **Data Minimization**: Freedelity collected and processed excessive personal data, including data from the eID card that was not necessary for the stated purposes. This included the eID card number, the issuing municipality, and the card's validity date, all considered irrelevant to the service offered by Freedelity and its retailers.
- **Data Retention**: The APD determined that Freedelity's data retention period of 8 years was excessive and not justified by the stated purposes of the data processing.

### Lack of free consent
The Autorité de protection des données (APD) found that Freedelity's consent mechanisms were not free because consumers were often pressured to consent to data processing in order to receive benefits. This lack of freedom stems from the way Freedelity and its partners bundled consent for data processing with the acceptance of commercial advantages.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

- **Bundled Consent:** In several instances, consumers were required to accept Freedelity's terms and conditions to benefit from commercial advantages offered by partner retailers. For example, one retailer required the acceptance of Freedelity's general conditions to benefit from the retailer's commercial advantages.
- **Lack of Choice:** This bundling of consent meant that consumers did not have a genuine choice to refuse the processing of their personal data while still receiving the commercial benefits. The APD stated that the acceptance of Freedelity's terms for commercial benefits showed a lack of freedom for the consumer.
- **Conditional Access:** The APD specifically noted that access to the commercial advantages offered by retailers should not be conditional on accepting other non-essential treatments or conditions, including the mutualization of data by Freedelity.
- **No Opt-Out:** The inability to opt out of data processing without losing access to commercial advantages demonstrated that the consent was not freely given.
- **Specific Examples:**
    - At one retailer, consumers had to accept Freedelity's terms to benefit from commercial advantages, which made the consent not free.
    - The APD highlighted that, even when consent for data processing was requested separately for the retailer and Freedelity, it still had to be demonstrated that the Freedelity consent was completely optional. Otherwise the consumer would be forced to consent to Freedelity to receive the retailer benefits.
    - In cases where consumers had to consent to data processing by Freedelity (particularly mutualization), to obtain the desired commercial advantages, the consent was deemed invalid because it was not free.

In summary, the APD concluded that the consent was not free because consumers were effectively forced to consent to data processing by Freedelity and its partners if they wished to receive the commercial benefits. This lack of genuine choice violated the GDPR requirement that consent must be freely given.

## Sanction

- **Corrective Measures:** The APD has ordered Freedelity to implement several corrective measures within four months. These include:
    - Implementing compliant consent mechanisms that ensure consent is free, informed, specific, and unambiguous.
    - Ensuring that access to commercial benefits is not conditional on accepting non-essential data processing terms.
    - Implementing simple, accessible mechanisms for consumers to withdraw their consent.
    - Ceasing the collection and processing of unnecessary data from eID cards, and deleting the non-essential data collected in the past.
    - Reducing the data retention period to a maximum of 3 years from the last consumer activity and deleting data kept longer than that.
- **Penalties for Non-Compliance**: Freedelity faces daily penalties (astreintes) of up to 5,000 euros for each day of non-compliance or partial compliance with the APD's orders after the four-month deadline.
- **Publication**: The APD's decision will be published on its website, directly identifying Freedelity.
- **Right of Appeal:** Freedelity has 30 days to appeal the decision.
