# Summary

Criminal liability for the illegal use of personal data arises when the data processing not only violates data protection regulations but also involves actions that are deemed harmful. These actions include those motivated by revenge, greed, or blackmail, or when significant harm is caused. The Data State Inspectorate is responsible for monitoring lawful data processing but **criminal cases fall under the jurisdiction of the State Police**. It is important to note that not all data breaches result in criminal charges; these are reserved for cases with additional factors that elevate the severity of the offense.

# Detail

## Factual Background

- The Data State Inspectorate monitors the legality of data processing and can impose binding obligations in data protection.
- The Inspectorate cannot investigate criminal cases or apply criminal sanctions.
- The principle of _ne bis in idem_ dictates that a person can only be punished once for the same offense.
- Complaints that suggest criminal activity should be directed to the State Police.
- If data processing violates regulations and includes actions or consequences that are considered criminal, the case falls under the jurisdiction of the State Police.
- A case example is provided where a store clerk misused a client's passport information to create a fraudulent loan agreement. In this instance the clerk committed a crime due to the illegal use of personal data for financial gain.
- Another example is provided that involves publishing personal data online to harm an individual. In this instance the individual experienced distress and unwanted contact. This case illustrates that harm is not only material, but includes emotional distress.

## Rule

- Criminal liability for illegal actions with personal data occurs when:
    - Data processing is not in accordance with data regulation requirements.
    - The data processing is done with the motive of revenge, greed, or blackmail.
    - The data processing causes **significant harm**.
- Significant harm can be considered as:
    - Financial loss that exceeds five times the minimum monthly salary and endangers other legally protected interests.
    - Financial loss that exceeds ten times the minimum monthly salary.
    - When other legally protected interests have been **significantly endangered**.
- **Not every violation of rights is considered significant harm**, and each case must be assessed individually.
- **The State Police is responsible for investigating and applying sanctions for criminal offenses** related to the illegal use of personal data.
