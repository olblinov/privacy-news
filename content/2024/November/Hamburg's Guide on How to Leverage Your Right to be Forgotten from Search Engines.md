# Summary

This document discusses recent decisions by the German Federal Court of Justice (BGH) and the European Court of Justice (CJEU) regarding the **right to be forgotten**, which allows individuals to have their personal data removed from the internet. The rulings clarify the conditions under which individuals can request the deletion of data from websites and search engines, balancing personal rights against public interest and freedom of expression. The document also details the process for making a claim for removal of search results and provides a link to a relevant online form.

# Detail

## Factual Background

The right to be forgotten enables individuals to control the personal information available about them on the internet. This right can be exercised either by requesting the deletion of data from the website where it appears or by requesting its removal from search engine results. Both the BGH and the CJEU have made rulings in 2024 that concern this right. The BGH ruled in **June 2024** that personal data of a former board member of an association must be removed from an online register 20 years after their departure, as the public interest in the data no longer outweighs their privacy rights. In **October 2024**, the CJEU ruled that personal data published online that does not fall under commercial disclosure requirements can be deleted or redacted.

## Rule

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), individuals have the right to request the deletion of their personal data online, unless the processing is necessary for exercising freedom of expression and information. This right is balanced against public interest, freedom of expression, press freedom, and the entrepreneurial freedom of search engine operators. A deletion claim is valid if the individual's fundamental rights outweigh these competing interests.

- **Search Engine De-listing:** If a website does not remove infringing content, individuals can request that search engines de-list the content so that it is not found via name-based searches.
- **Evidence of Inaccuracy:** To compel a search engine to de-list content, the individual must provide **relevant and sufficient evidence** that the information is **manifestly inaccurate**. This evidence can come from a court decision or other proof. However, the right to freedom of expression and information is significant, and even inaccurate data might not be removed if it contributes to a debate of general interest.
- **Balancing Interests:** Courts must balance individual privacy rights with the public interest in information. The way information is disseminated and made searchable online can be particularly burdensome for individuals, requiring consideration of the public interest on a case-by-case basis.
- **Making a Claim:** Individuals can assert their right to be forgotten using online forms provided by search engine operators. For example, Google provides such a form, and the Hamburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (HmbBfDI) has oversight over Google.
