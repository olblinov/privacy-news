# Summary

The document, SP 800-172 Rev. 3, is an initial public draft that provides **enhanced security requirements for protecting Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)** in nonfederal systems and organizations. This publication is intended for use by federal agencies in contracts or agreements with nonfederal entities and is focused on safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of CUI, particularly when associated with high-value assets or critical programs. The enhanced requirements are designed to defend against advanced persistent threats and supplement the security requirements outlined in SP 800-171r3. Key changes in this revision include increased specificity, alignment with SP 800-53, new security requirements based on recent threat intelligence and cyber attacks, and new requirement families. The public comment period for this draft is open until January 10, 2025.

# Detail

SP 800-172r3 provides recommended security requirements to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of CUI when it is resident in a nonfederal system and organization and is associated with a high value asset or critical program. The enhanced security requirements give organizations the capability to achieve a multidimensional, defense-in-depth protection strategy against advanced persistent threats (APTs) and help to ensure the resiliency of systems and organizations. The enhanced security requirements in SP 800-172r3 supplement the security requirements in [SP 800-171r3](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/171/r3/final) and are intended for use by federal agencies in contractual vehicles or other agreements between those agencies and nonfederal organizations. There is no expectation that all of the enhanced security requirements are needed universally; enhanced security requirements are selected by federal agencies based on specific mission needs and risks.

Significant changes in SP 800-172r3 include:

- Increased the specificity of the enhanced security requirements to remove ambiguity, improve the effectiveness of implementation, and clarify the scope of assessments
- Revised the enhanced security requirements for consistency with the source security control language in SP 800-53
- Updated the numbering system for enhanced security requirements and added titles to the requirements
- Added new enhanced security requirements based on (1) the latest threat intelligence, (2) empirical data from cyber attacks, and (3) the expansion of security objectives to include integrity and availability
- Added new requirement families for consistency with SP 800-171r3: Planning (PL), System and Services Acquisition (SA), and Supply Chain Risk Management (SR)
- Removed outdated and redundant enhanced security requirements
- Implemented a one-time “revision number” change for consistency with SP 800-171r3.
