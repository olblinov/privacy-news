# Summary

The Autoridade Nacional de Proteção de Dados (ANPD) in Brazil investigated TikTok’s data processing practices following a 2021 complaint, uncovering significant privacy violations regarding children and adolescents. TikTok collects personal data, including from children, via a "feed sem cadastro" feature that bypasses account creation and ineffective age verification measures, using this data for content personalization and targeted advertising without a valid legal basis. These practices breach several provisions of the LGPD, including the requirement to prioritize children's best interests, process data with a valid legal basis, and ensure accountability. Consequently, the ANPD mandated the immediate suspension of the "feed sem cadastro" in Brazil, required TikTok to implement a compliance plan with effective safeguards for children’s data, and initiated administrative sanctions, demanding proof of compliance within ten business days.
# Detail
## Factual Background

- The Autoridade Nacional de Proteção de Dados (ANPD) in Brazil initiated an investigation into TikTok's data processing practices, particularly regarding children and adolescents, following a complaint in March 2021.
- The investigation found that TikTok collects personal data from users, including children, even when they do not have an account, through a feature called the "feed sem cadastro" (feed without registration). This allows users to access content without creating an account.
- The investigation also revealed that TikTok's age verification mechanisms are not effective at preventing children under 13 from accessing the platform.
- The "feed sem cadastro" allows children to bypass the age verification process.
- TikTok uses personal data collected through the "feed sem cadastro," including children's data, to personalize content and target advertising. TikTok uses the legal basis of contract execution to justify the personalization of content, even in the "feed sem cadastro," but the ANPD argues that this legal basis is not applicable without a contract or agreement between the user and TikTok.
- The ANPD has issued a number of requests for information and technical notes to TikTok requesting changes to these practices.
- TikTok has been unresponsive to many of the requests for more information, and is not transparent about its data collection practices.

## Violation

- **Violation of Article 14 of the LGPD (Brazilian General Data Protection Law)**, which mandates that the processing of children's and adolescents' personal data must always consider their best interests. TikTok's lack of effective age verification and processing of data in the "feed sem cadastro" puts children's privacy and security at risk.
- **Violation of the requirement to process data based on a valid legal basis**, as required by Article 7 of the LGPD. The use of "execution of contract" as a legal basis for data processing in the "feed sem cadastro" is not applicable, because there is no contract between the user and TikTok in this case.
- **Violation of the principle of purpose limitation**, which stipulates that data processing must be for legitimate, specific, explicit and informed purposes. TikTok collects children’s data for behavioral profiling and advertising purposes, which is considered abusive under Brazilian law.
- **Violation of the principle of accountability and responsibility**. TikTok failed to demonstrate the effectiveness of its data protection measures, particularly for children.
- **Failure to adopt technical measures** to prevent damage, as required by Article 6, VIII, of the LGPD. TikTok did not implement effective measures to prevent children and adolescents from interacting with the platform.

## Sanction

- **Immediate suspension of the "feed sem cadastro" feature** in Brazil, to prevent further data collection and processing of children's and adolescents' personal data without adequate age verification and legal basis.
- **Requirement for TikTok to develop and implement a compliance plan**, including effective age verification mechanisms, improved mechanisms to verify age when deleting accounts, mechanisms for parental assistance for adolescents, and continuous effectiveness evaluation.
- **Initiation of an administrative sanctioning process** [114, 13.7].
- The company must demonstrate compliance within ten business days.
