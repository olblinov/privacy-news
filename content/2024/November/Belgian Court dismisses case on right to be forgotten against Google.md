# Summary

This case involves a complaint against Google LLC and Google Belgium for refusing to dereference URLs containing personal data about the plaintiff. The plaintiff was convicted of serious offenses in 2008, and articles about these convictions were indexed by Google. The plaintiff requested the removal of these links, but Google refused, citing public interest. The plaintiff then filed a complaint with the Data Protection Authority (APD) after a failed mediation attempt, which was ultimately dismissed. The Chamber Contentieuse decided to close the case because the plaintiff initially targeted the newspaper responsible for publishing the article and because a request for URL 2 was not made to Google beforehand. The Chamber Contentieuse further found that the balance between the public's right to information and the plaintiff's right to privacy favored the freedom of expression in this case.

# Detail

## Factual Background

- The plaintiff was convicted in 2008 for serious offenses and articles were published about the conviction.
- The plaintiff requested Google to dereference two URLs (URL 1 and URL 2) linking to these articles.
- Google refused the request, citing the public interest in accessing the information.
- The plaintiff initially contacted the newspaper that published the article (Journal Y) which then suggested contacting Google for dereferencing.
- The plaintiff filed a mediation request with the APD, which was later converted to a formal complaint after mediation failed.
- The plaintiff's initial complaint to the APD identified the newspaper as the responsible party for the data processing.
- The APD's First Line Service (SPL) addressed Google regarding the dereferencing, but the plaintiff had only requested dereferencing of URL 1 before filing the complaint.
- The Chamber Contentieuse was informed that the plaintiff did not request dereferencing of URL 2 directly with Google prior to filing the complaint.
- The Chamber Contentieuse noted that the SPL did not fully inform the plaintiff of the dual options available to them: filing a complaint against either the publisher or the search engine.

## Violation

- The plaintiff claimed a violation of their right to be forgotten under the GDPR, seeking to have the URLs removed from Google's search results.
- The Chamber Contentieuse noted that the plaintiff’s complaint was initially directed at the newspaper that published the articles, not Google.
- The Chamber Contentieuse found that the plaintiff had not made a prior request to Google regarding URL 2 before filing the complaint with the APD.
- The Chamber Contentieuse stated that the right to be forgotten (or dereferencing) is not absolute, especially when balanced against freedom of expression and the public's right to information.
- The Chamber Contentieuse determined that the public's interest in accessing information about the plaintiff's serious offenses outweighed the plaintiff’s right to privacy, particularly due to the gravity of the offenses and the public's interest in the subject matter.

## Sanction

- The Chamber Contentieuse decided to **close the case without further action**.
- The decision to close the case was based on two main technical grounds:
    - The initial complaint misidentified the responsible party as the newspaper rather than Google.
    - The plaintiff had not made a prior request to Google for the dereferencing of URL 2, failing to follow proper procedure for exhausting all options of recourse.
- The Chamber Contentieuse also concluded that the plaintiff's claim for dereferencing was unfounded under Article 17.3.a) of the GDPR because of the public interest in the information.
- No sanctions or corrective measures were imposed on Google in this case.
