# Summary

This document, titled "Orientation Aid of the Supervisory Authorities for Providers of Digital Services (OH Digital Services)", provides guidance on the implementation of the Telecommunications Digital Services Data Protection Act (TDDDG) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for digital service providers. It focuses on the **protection of privacy when using end devices**, particularly regarding the storage of and access to information on these devices. The document explains when consent is required for such actions, what constitutes valid consent, and exceptions to the consent requirement. It also addresses the legality of data processing under the GDPR, the design of consent banners, and the rights of data subjects. The document emphasizes the need for transparency, voluntariness, and specificity when obtaining consent.

# Details

- **Scope and Application of TDDDG**: The TDDDG aims to protect privacy when using end devices, regardless of whether personal data is involved. It applies to providers of digital services, which are defined as information society services provided electronically, at a distance, and upon individual request. The law applies to those with a branch in the territory of the law, or those who provide services in the territory of the law.
- **Relationship between TDDDG and GDPR**: The TDDDG has specific regulations for the storage of and access to information on end devices, which take precedence over the GDPR when personal data is processed. However, subsequent processing of personal data is subject to the requirements of the GDPR.
- **Consent Requirement**: According to ยง 25 TDDDG, the **storage of information on end devices or access to information already stored on them requires the consent of the end-user**. This applies regardless of whether the information is personal or not. The definition of end devices includes any device connected to a public telecommunications network, such as smartphones, computers, smart TVs, and connected vehicles. Examples of information that is often stored or accessed include cookies, web storage objects, device identifiers, and browser fingerprints.
- **Bundling of Consents**: Consent for the storage and reading of information according to ยง 25 TDDDG can be bundled with consent according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR, if the users are informed about all purposes of data processing that follow the access of the end device. It is key that it is clear that a single action implies multiple consent.
- **Requirements for Consent**: Consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. It must be given by the end-user of the device, before the access takes place, and with clear information about who is accessing the device, how, and for what purpose. The user must also be informed about the duration of the cookies and whether third parties can access them. Consent must be given through a clear affirmative action, such as clicking a designated button.
    - **Informed Consent**: The information provided should include the purposes of data processing, the duration of cookies, and whether third parties have access.
    - **Unambiguous Action**: Consent must be given through an active action by the user, such as clicking a button, not through inactivity or pre-checked boxes.
    - **Freely Given Consent**: Consent must be voluntary, meaning users have a real choice and control. It should not be implied by using a website or by actions like scrolling. The possibility of rejecting consent must be as easy as giving it.
    - **Specific Purpose**: Consent must be obtained for specific purposes, not general or vague ones.
- **Exceptions to Consent**: There are two exceptions to the consent requirement. Consent is not required when the storage or access is solely for:
    - **Carrying out the transmission of a message** over a public telecommunications network.
    - **Providing a digital service** explicitly requested by the user. This requires that the storage of or access to information be essential for the service and that the service is explicitly requested.
- **Digital Service**: It is important to determine what constitutes a digital service. It can be a website as a whole or specific functions or contents of a website. It's necessary to look at what the user wants when using a website. This means that a distinction is made between a base service, which is essential for the whole offer, and additional functions, that can be used independently of the category of the digital service.
- **"Absolutely Necessary"**: This refers to when access to the end device is technically required to provide a user requested service. The criterion of necessity relates solely to the functionality of the digital service. This also applies to the time of the storage, the lifetime of the cookies, its content, and the domain setting the cookie.
- **Reach Measurement**: The document also discusses the concept of Reichweitenmessung, or reach measurement, which is the counting of how often a website is called up. It can be difficult to determine whether this is something that can take place without consent, because it can have different purposes. Therefore the question of whether reach measurement is part of a base service depends on its specific purpose.
- **Legality of Processing under GDPR**: Processing of personal data, such as tracking user behavior, must comply with the GDPR. This includes having a legal basis for processing under Article 6 of the GDPR, such as consent, contract, legal obligation, public interest, or legitimate interests. It is important to note that the legality of the storage of and access to information under TDDDG is directly linked to the subsequent processing under GDPR.
- **Consent Banners**: The document provides guidance on designing consent banners, which are often used to obtain user consent. Such banners should only be used when consent is actually required. They should clearly display the purposes of processing, the involved parties, and enable users to activate selections without pre-selected options. The document also notes that the information can be displayed through a layered approach. It also notes that when services of third parties are used, it is not sufficient to note that information is shared with "partners". Rather the purposes of processing must be explained, especially if profiles will be created or data will be enriched.
    - The document notes that while the display of the banner is in place, no scripts that can access the end device or process data may be loaded. Access to the Impressum and the privacy policy must be accessible despite the banner.
    - A rejection function is not necessary if users are not forced to interact with the consent banner in order to use the website. However, it should be present at the first layer of the banner when users must interact with the banner to access the website.
    - The possibility of withdrawing consent must be as easy as giving it.
- **Dark Patterns**: The design of consent banners should not manipulate users into giving consent. It is important to ensure that the option to decline consent is equally visible and easy to use as the option to give consent. An alternative option to giving consent needs to be easily recognizable.
- **Data Subject Rights**: The document outlines data subject rights, such as the right to information, access, and erasure, as they apply to digital services. If personal data, such as cookies, are processed, the data subject rights according to GDPR apply.

## Reach Measurement (in detail)

The document discusses "Reichweitenmessung," or **reach measurement**, in the context of websites and apps, explaining that it has evolved from simple counting to a complex analysis of user behavior.

Here's a breakdown of key points and considerations:

- **Evolution of Reach Measurement**: Originally, reach measurement involved counting the number of readers, viewers, or listeners of media. In the context of websites, this translates to counting how often a page is accessed (page impressions). However, modern reach analysis often involves processing extensive user data to provide more in-depth insights.
    
- **Data Collection**:
    
    - Basic reach measurement involves a simple count of page views using log files, or implementing a basic pixel on the website.
    - Modern reach analysis often collects a wide range of user information including devices, software, times, user IDs, and user-defined variables. It also tracks user behavior on the website, such as entry and exit pages, page titles, internal searches, downloads, and user inputs. This information is used to analyze the average time spent on a page, bounce rates, actions per visit, page views, and how users accessed the website.
- **Purpose**: The data collected can be used to make decisions for the future which can serve the interests of the provider, the user, or third parties. It is used to develop business models, determine the sales value of advertising space, improve the placement of frequently accessed content, identify malfunctions, and determine the scope of legal protection rights of authors.
    
- **Specificity**: The term "reach measurement" is often too vague. The document points out that **it is important to define the specific configuration and purpose** of any reach measurement activities to determine whether it requires user consent. Any such determination would not be valid if further information about the users or additional evaluation results are included.
    
- **Purpose of Data Collection**: The purpose for which "reach measurement" is used is crucial for determining whether the service is a digital service explicitly requested by the user. Even basic counting of visitors is not automatically part of the base service but depends on the specific purpose.
    
- **Third Party Services**: When third-party services are used for reach measurement, it is important to note that the storage of information on the user's device and the retrieval of that information is not always attributable to just one service. This can be the basis of multiple services.
    
- **Consent**: The document implies that depending on the purpose of the reach measurement activity, user consent might be required.
    

**Specific Tests/Considerations**

The document does not provide specific tests for reach measurement, but it does give criteria for providers of digital services to consider when evaluating whether an exception to the consent requirement applies (ยง 25 Abs. 2 Nr. 2 TDDDG):

- **Granular Definition**: Providers must define precisely which specific storage and reading process on the end device corresponds to which function of the digital service.
- **Primary Interests**: The provider needs to determine whose interests the function serves, whether it be their own interests, the user, a third-party service provider, or other third parties.
- **Timing**: The storage and reading of information on the end device can only begin when the specific function of the digital service is actually used by the user.
- **Content**: The stored and read information must be absolutely necessary for the specifically defined function of the digital service. For example, if cookies are being used, the focus should not be on the cookie itself but the information stored in the cookie.
- **Duration**: The storage time should be limited to the time needed for the specific function of the service. Session cookies are preferred over long-lasting ones.
- **Accessibility**: It must be determined who can access and use the information from the end device.

In summary, the document suggests that the legality of reach measurement depends on a granular analysis of its purpose, the data collected, and how it is implemented.

## Dark Patterns (in detail)

The document refers to "dark patterns" in the context of designing consent banners, specifically in relation to social media platforms. It explains that while some level of behavioral steering (or "nudging") is permitted in the design of these banners, it becomes impermissible when it interferes with the requirements for valid consent.

Here's a more detailed explanation:

- **Definition**: Dark patterns refer to design choices that are used to steer user behavior, particularly in the context of obtaining consent for data processing or other online activities. The document uses the term "nudging" to describe the general concept of influencing behavior through design.
    
- **Permissible Nudging vs. Dark Patterns:** Some level of influencing user behavior through design is acceptable, but it should not reach the point where it undermines the requirements for a valid consent, as defined in Art. 4 No. 11 and Art. 7 of the GDPR. The key is to ensure that users have a genuine choice and are not manipulated into giving consent.
    
- **Key Factors**: Several factors can contribute to an impermissible dark pattern:
    
    - **Lack of Clear Choice**: If the alternative to giving consent isn't easily visible or understandable, it can create an imbalance that suggests that consent is the only viable option.
    - **Information Overload**: Overwhelming users with excessive or confusing information can also be a dark pattern. This can hinder their ability to make an informed decision.
    - **Misleading Information**: The use of deceptive language or information presented in a way that downplays the implications of consenting can be a factor.
    - **Hidden Options**: If the option to decline consent is hidden or not as prominent as the option to consent, users may be manipulated into giving consent. This can include placing the decline option outside of the banner, or not clearly highlighting the option.
    - **Unequal Visual Prominence**: If the option to decline consent is visually less prominent or easily missed due to size, color, contrast, or font, the ability to decline is not considered a "genuine choice."
    - **Scroll Requirement**: If the option to decline is not visible without scrolling, it is not considered easily visible or a genuine choice.
    - **Unclear Language**: If the language used on buttons is unclear, for example, if a button says "Settings or Decline" instead of a clear "Decline" button, then this can contribute to a dark pattern.
- **Importance of Equal Options**: The document stresses that users must be able to identify their options at a glance, regardless of the screen size of their device. The option to decline should be as straightforward and easily accessible as the option to consent.
    
- **Individual Assessment**: The determination of whether a design constitutes a dark pattern requires a case-by-case evaluation. It is not usually a single design choice but rather the combination of various elements that may be problematic.
    
- **Reference to Guidelines**: The document references the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) "Guidelines 3/2022 on Dark patterns in social media platform interfaces: How to recognise and avoid them" for further guidance. Although these guidelines are written for social media platforms, they can be applied to the design of consent banners on websites as well.
    

In summary, the document highlights the importance of designing consent banners in a way that provides users with a genuine choice. The design should not manipulate or coerce users into giving consent by using dark patterns. The option to decline must be as visible, accessible, and straightforward as the option to consent.
