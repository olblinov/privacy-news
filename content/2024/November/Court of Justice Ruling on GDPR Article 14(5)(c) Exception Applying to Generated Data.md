# Summary

The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has issued a ruling clarifying the scope of the exception in Article 14(5)(c) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) concerning the obligation to provide information to data subjects when their personal data is not collected directly from them. The CJEU determined that the exception applies not only to data obtained from third parties but also to data generated by the data controller itself, provided that the data processing is expressly laid down by law and that the law includes appropriate safeguards for the data subject's interests. Additionally, the CJEU ruled that **a supervisory authority is competent to verify whether national law provides adequate protection for data subjects’ rights** in the context of this exception, but **this does not extend to the appropriateness of security measures under Article 32 of the GDPR**.

# Detail

## Factual Background

- The case originated from a dispute between the Nemzeti Adatvédelmi és Információszabadság Hatóság (National Authority for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, Hungary) and UC, concerning the issuing of COVID-19 immunity certificates by the Budapest Metropolitan Government Office (the issuing authority).
- The issuing authority generated some of the data on the immunity certificates, like the serial number of the certificate, in addition to collecting data from other sources.
- UC filed a complaint with the national authority, arguing that the issuing authority had not provided sufficient information about the processing of his personal data.
- The national authority rejected UC’s complaint, stating that the issuing authority was exempt from the obligation to provide information under Article 14(5)(c) of the GDPR.
- The case was appealed and eventually reached the Kúria (Supreme Court, Hungary), which referred questions to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling. The questions concerned the interpretation of Article 14(1) and (5)(c), Article 32 and Article 77(1) of the GDPR.
- The questions specifically addressed whether the exception in Article 14(5)(c) applies to data generated by the controller, whether a supervisory authority is competent to verify if national law provides appropriate measures, and whether this includes verifying security measures under Article 32.

## Rule

- **Scope of Article 14(5)(c) Exception:** The CJEU clarified that the exception in Article 14(5)(c) of the GDPR applies to all personal data not collected directly from the data subject. This includes both data obtained from a third party and data generated by the controller itself during its operations.
- The court reasoned that the wording of Article 14(5)(c) refers to "obtaining or disclosure" of personal data, and that the concept of "processing," as per Article 4(2) of the GDPR, covers any operation performed on personal data.
- The CJEU noted that the exception in Article 14(5)(c) is justified when another law imposes a binding obligation to provide information, ensuring data subjects have sufficient knowledge of processing.
- The court emphasized that the purpose of the GDPR is to protect fundamental rights, including the right to privacy, and that Article 14(5)(c) cannot undermine this objective.
- The exception in Article 14(5)(c) requires that data processing be expressly laid down by Union or Member State law and that this law provides appropriate measures to protect the data subject’s legitimate interests. This aims to ensure a level of protection at least equivalent to that under Article 14(1) to (4).
- **Competence of Supervisory Authorities:** The CJEU ruled that supervisory authorities are competent to verify if Member State law provides appropriate measures to protect data subjects' legitimate interests, as required by Article 14(5)(c). This competence arises from the general task of supervisory authorities to monitor and enforce the application of the GDPR.
- Supervisory authorities can assess whether national law sufficiently specifies the types of data to be obtained or generated and how the data subject can access the information required by Article 14(1), (2), and (4).
- A supervisory authority’s role is to decide whether the controller was entitled to rely on the exception in a particular case and not to examine the validity of national laws.
- **Exclusion of Article 32 Verification:** The CJEU clarified that the verification by a supervisory authority **does not extend to the appropriateness of security measures that the controller must implement under Article 32** of the GDPR. While Article 32 requires controllers to implement technical and organizational measures to ensure an appropriate level of security, these measures are separate from the obligation to provide information .
- The court emphasized that Article 32 is an obligation in all circumstances and is separate from Article 14 which deals specifically with the obligation to provide information .
