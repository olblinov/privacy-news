# Summary

The Data State Inspectorate has identified common errors in the design of cookie banners on websites. These errors include not providing the necessary information about cookies, failing to offer users the option to decline non-essential cookies, and designing banners that are misleading or not in the same language as the website. The most common issues involve failing to provide a link to the privacy policy or cookie policy, and not giving the user an easy way to opt out of non-essential cookies. These practices are not compliant with data protection regulations.

# Detail

## Factual Background

- The Data State Inspectorate has issued guidelines on the correct use of cookies on websites.
- Despite these guidelines, many websites still have non-compliant cookie banners.
- The most frequent issues include:
    - **Missing or non-functioning cookie notifications**
    - **Processing cookies even when the user has not consented**
    - **Banners that are not in the same language as the website**
- The purpose of a cookie banner is to inform the user about the types of cookies being processed and to get their consent when necessary.
- If a website only uses functional cookies, then a short description and a button such as "I understand" is sufficient.
- If a website uses non-essential cookies, the banner must provide options to consent or decline.
- A link to a privacy or cookie policy with a more detailed explanation of cookie processing is required.
- Users must be able to easily opt out of non-essential cookies, and this function should be on the website and not via the browser settings.
- The user's choice cannot be pre-selected and the banner must be neutral in design.
- The website must not imply that access to the site will be restricted if non-essential cookies are not accepted.

## Rule

- A cookie banner must be simple and clear, without misleading information.
- The user must be informed about which cookies will be processed without their consent and which they can consent to if they wish.
- Non-essential cookies can only be processed with the user's consent.
- The cookie banner must be in the same language as the website.
- The choice must be the user's, and it cannot be pre-selected.
- The banner should not lead the user to make a particular choice and must be neutral.
- The site must provide an easy way to opt-out of cookies.
- It cannot be implied that the website will not function fully if a user refuses to accept non-essential cookies.
- Website owners are responsible for their users' data.
- Data processing is illegal if the relevant requirements are not met.
