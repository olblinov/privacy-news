Today, _noyb_ filed a complaint against the social media platform Pinterest. Most users probably know it as a visual mood board and use it to find ideas and inspiration. Advertisers, on the other hand, use the platform to push their products on consumers. Unsurprisingly, Pinterest’s business model is also based on personalised advertising and the associated user tracking. The problem: Despite a CJEU ruling prohibiting this practice, the platform uses people’s personal data without asking for their consent. Pinterest falsely claims to have a “legitimate interest” and enables tracking by default. Most other websites have abandoned this legally flawed argument years ago.
