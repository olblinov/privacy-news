The Bundeskartellamt has concluded its Facebook proceeding. The result of the proceeding is a bundle of measures that gives users of the social network Facebook significantly improved options regarding the combination of their data.

Meta had gradually taken or agreed to take the following measures to implement the authority’s decision:

- Introducing an Accounts Centre (see [press release of 7 June 2023](https://www.bundeskartellamt.de/SharedDocs/Meldung/EN/Pressemitteilungen/2023/07_06_2023_Meta_Daten.html?nn=48916 "Meta (Facebook) introduces new accounts center – an important step in the implementation of the Bundeskartellamt’s decision")) to keep data collected from Meta’s different services separate: The Accounts Centre allows users to decide themselves which Meta services (e.g. Facebook and Instagram) they would like to connect and thus allow data to be shared between these services also for advertising purposes. It is still possible to use the services separately without experiencing a significant loss in quality.
- Introducing “cookie” settings that allow Facebook data to be separated from other data: Facebook’s “cookie” settings now allow users to decide whether they want to allow their Facebook data to be combined with data Meta collects from third-party websites or apps using its so-called business tools. This also applies to Instagram.
- Special exception for Facebook Login: Users who choose not to combine their Facebook data with their data collected while using other websites or apps can make an exception for Facebook Login to still be able to use this log-in option in third-party apps or on third-party websites. Previously, users had to allow Meta to combine all user data with data from third-party apps or websites if they wanted to use Facebook Login.
- Concise customer information: To help Meta’s customers quickly find the relevant settings to prevent the unwanted combination of data by Meta, users who have agreed to data being combined in the past are shown prominent notifications when accessing Facebook. These notifications contain direct links to the newly designed consent options.
- User navigation: Meta has added a prominent notice at the beginning of its data policy, informing users about their options ([https://en-gb.facebook.com/privacy/policy/?entry_point=facebook_page_footer](https://de-de.facebook.com/privacy/policy/ "External link Link zur Datenrichtlinie Wahlmöglichkeiten der Nutzenden") “How to manage the info that we use”). This contains a short explanation and links to the Accounts Centre and “cookie” settings.
- Limited combination of data for security purposes: Regardless of the user’s settings in Facebook or Instagram, Meta stores and combines usage data for security purposes. However, this is done only temporarily and for no longer than a standardised period of time defined in advance.
