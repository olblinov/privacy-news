The inquiry examined LinkedIn’s processing of personal data for the purposes of behavioural analysis and targeted advertising of users who have created LinkedIn profiles (members). The decision includes a reprimand, an order for LinkedIn to bring its processing into compliance, and administrative fines totalling €310 million.

This inquiry examined the lawfulness, fairness and transparency of the processing of the personal data of users of the LinkedIn platform for the purposes of behavioural analysis and targeted advertising. The personal data in question encompassed data provided directly to LinkedIn by its members (first-party data) and data obtained via its third-party partners relating to its members (third-party data).

The DPC’s final decision records the following findings of infringement of the GDPR:

- Article 6 GDPR and Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, insofar as it requires the processing of personal data to be lawful, as LinkedIn:
	- Did not validly rely on Article 6(1)(a) GDPR (**consent**) to process third party data of its members for the purpose of behavioural analysis and targeted advertising on the basis that the consent obtained by LinkedIn was not freely given, sufficiently informed or specific, or unambiguous.
	- Did not validly rely on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (**legitimate interests**) for its processing of first party personal data of its members for behavioural analysis and targeted advertising, or third party data for analytics, as LinkedIn’s interests were overridden by the interests and fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects.
	- Did not validly rely on Article 6(1)(b) GDPR (**contractual necessity**) to process first party data of its members for the purpose of behavioural analysis and targeted advertising.
- Articles 13(1)(c) and 14(1)(c) GDPR, in respect of the information LinkedIn provided to data subjects regarding its reliance on Article 6(1)(a), Article 6(1)(b) and Article 6(1)(f) GDPR as lawful bases.
- Article 5(1)(a) GDPR, the principle of fairness.
