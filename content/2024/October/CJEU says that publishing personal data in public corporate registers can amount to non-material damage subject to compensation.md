OL is a member of ‘Praven Shtit Konsulting’ OOD, a limited liability company governed by Bulgarian law, which was registered on 14 January 2021 in the commercial register following the submission of a company’s constitutive instrument dated 30 December 2020 and signed by the members of that company (‘the constitutive instrument concerned’).

That instrument, which includes the surname, first name, identification number, identity card number, date and place of issue of that card, as well as OL’s address and signature, was made available to the public by the Agency as submitted.

On 8 July 2021, OL requested the Agency to erase the personal data relating to her contained in that constitutive instrument, stating that, if the processing of those data was based on her consent, she was withdrawing that consent.

In the absence of a reply from the Agency, OL brought an action before the Administrativen sad Dobrich (Administrative Court, Dobrich, Bulgaria) which, by a judgment of 8 December 2021, annulled the implied refusal of the Agency to erase those data and referred the case back to the Agency for a new decision.

Outcomes:
- Article 4(1) of Regulation 2016/679: must be interpreted as meaning that the handwritten signature of a natural person is covered by the concept of ‘personal data’ within the meaning of that provision.
- Article 82(1) of Regulation 2016/679: must be interpreted as meaning that a loss of control, for a limited period, by the data subject over his or her personal data, on account of those data being made available online to the public, in the commercial register of a Member State, may suffice to cause ‘non-material damage’, provided that that data subject demonstrates that he or she has actually suffered such damage, however minimal, without that concept of ‘non-material damage’ requiring that the existence of additional tangible adverse consequences be demonstrated.
