The Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) concluded his case investigation into the Ricardo auction platform on 11 April 2024. In his final report, he recommended that Ricardo AG and the TX Group AG make data transfers and cross-platform tracking for the purpose of targeted advertising transparent and obtain valid consent for these practices from their users.

Ricardo and the TX Group were processing personal data, particularly as the data on the users were always linked to a unique pseudonym. He also found that the cross-platform tracking led to the creation of personality profiles and that Ricardo members were not adequately informed about the tracking and the subsequent use of data for targeted advertising. The resulting breaches of privacy could not be justified by the overriding private interests that Ricardo and the TX Group claimed. Furthermore, valid consent was not obtained, not least because users of the Ricardo platform were not adequately informed about the data processing.
