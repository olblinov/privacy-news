On 3 August 2023, Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) received two freedom of information requests from the same person via WhatDoTheyKnow (WDTK). The first asked for “… the number of officers at each rank and number of staff at each grade …”, the second asking for a distinction between “how many are substantive / temporary / acting …”. 
  
The information was downloaded as an Excel file with a single worksheet from PSNI’s human resources management system (SAP). The data included: surnames and first name initials, job role, rank, grade, department, location of post, contract type, gender and PSNI service and staff number.  
  
As the information was analysed for disclosure, multiple other worksheets were created within the downloaded Excel file. On completion, all visible onscreen worksheet tabs were deleted from the Excel file. The original worksheet, containing the personal details, remained unnoticed and this was also not picked up despite quality assurance.
