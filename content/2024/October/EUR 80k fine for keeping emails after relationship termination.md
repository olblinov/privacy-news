**Guarantor: stop the software that accesses the employee's email  
_Sanction of 80 thousand euros to a company that made backups during the employment relationship_**

The employer cannot access the employee's or employee's email or use software to keep a copy of the messages. In addition to configuring a violation of the personal data protection regulations, such processing of personal data is suitable for carrying out an illegal worker control activity.

[The Privacy Guarantor established it by sanctioning a company for 80 thousand euros.](https://www.garanteprivacy.it/garante/doc.jsp?ID=10053224)

The Guarantor, who intervened following the complaint lodged by a sales agent, ascertained that during the collaboration relationship, through a software, the company had made a backup of the e-mail, keeping both the contents and the access logs to the email and to the corporate management.

The information collected was then used by the company in a dispute.

The Authority also ascertained the unsuitability and lack of information provided to workers. The document in fact provided for the possibility for the employer to access the e-mail of its employees and collaborators to guarantee the continuity of the business activity, in the event of their absence or termination of the relationship, without mentioning, among other things, the carrying out of the backup and the relative retention time.

In defining the procedure, the **Guarantor stated that the systematic conservation of emails - carried out for a considerable period of time (equal to three years after the termination of the relationship) â€“ and the systematic conservation of access logs to e-mail and management used by workers did not comply with the data protection regulations.** In fact, this conservation was not proportionate and necessary to achieve the purposes declared by the Company to guarantee the security of the IT network and the continuity of the company's business.

This also allowed the Company to reconstruct, in detail, the activity of the collaborator, thus incurring a form of control prohibited by the Workers' Statute.

Finally, as regards the use of data in court, the Guarantor recalls that the processing carried out by accessing the employee's e-mail for protection purposes in the judicial field refers to disputes already in place, not to abstract and indeterminate protection hypotheses such as in this case.

In addition to the penalty, the Authority has ordered the prohibition of further processing of data through the software used for backing up e-mail.
