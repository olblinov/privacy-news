- Controllers should have the information on the identity (i.e. name, address, contact person) of all processors, sub-processors etc. readily available at all times so that they can best fulfil their obligations under Article 28 GDPR
- Processor should proactively provide to the controller all this information and should keep them up to date at all times
- Engagement of processors should not lower the level of protection for the rights of data subjects. The controller’s obligation to verify whether the (sub-)processors present ‘sufficient guarantees’ to implement the appropriate measures determined by the controller should apply regardless of the risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. However, the extent of such verification will in practice vary depending on the nature of these technical and organisational measures, which may be stricter or more extensive depending on the level of such risk
- Controller may choose to rely on the information received from its processor and build on it if needed (for example, where it seems incomplete, inaccurate or raises questions). More specifically, for processing presenting a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, the controller should increase its level of verification in terms of checking the information provided.
