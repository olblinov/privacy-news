COSMOSPACE and TELEMAQUE provide remote clairvoyance services, one by telephone and the other via online chat and text messages.

### Failure to comply with the obligation to minimise personal data collection and processing by COSMOSPACE (Article 5.1.c of the GDPR)

COSMOSPACE systematically **recorded all telephone calls** made between clairvoyants, customers and switchboard operators. The company considered that such recordings were justified to **monitor the service quality and for training purposes**, to demonstrate that the contract had been taken out and properly performed, to respond to legal requests and, lastly, for the purposes of safeguarding human life.

The restricted committee considered that these **purposes did not justify recording all calls** in a complete and systematic manner, specifying that these recordings should be limited, on the one hand, to a sample of conversations to verify the service quality and to ensure the training of employees and, on the other hand, to calls made between operators and customers or prospects for the part clearly relating to the conclusion of the contract. 

### Failure to comply with the obligation to retain data for a period limited to the intended purpose (Article 5.1.e of the GDPR)

COSMOSPACE retained its **customers’ data for six years** from the end of the commercial relationship, in order to be able to send commercial prospection communications.

The restricted committee recalled that the CNIL recommended a **retention period limited to three years for this purpose** and considered that the company had not demonstrated the need to retain the data twice as long. It emphasised the inconvenience that could be caused by sending such messages over such a long period. #retention 

TELEMAQUE retained its customers’ data in an active database for a **period of six years**, without restricting access to this data or sorting it in any way.

The restricted committee recalled that if certain customer data could be retained at the end of the commercial relationship (for example, for litigation or pre-litigation purposes), it was the company's responsibility to sort through this data, to retain only what is necessary for these purposes, and to limit access to it by archiving it on an intermediate basis.

### Failure to comply with the obligation to obtain prior consent from individuals to process special categories of personal data (Article 9 of the GDPR)

During consultations by telephone, chat or text messages, customers may be asked to reveal data relating to their **sexual orientation or sex life, their religious beliefs or their state of health.** Moreover, the online users of COSMOSPACE and TELEMAQUE could fill in a form to make a prediction about their compatibility with a person of their choice, enabling them to deduce their sexual orientation.
