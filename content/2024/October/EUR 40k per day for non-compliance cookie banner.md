In July 2023, _noyb_ filed [complaints against a total of 15 Belgian news websites](https://noyb.eu/en/belgian-dpa-let-news-outlets-buy-themselves-free-gdpr-compliance) for using deceptive cookie banners. Although these companies had already been the subject of a DPA investigation in previous years and were found to have failed to comply with the GDPR, they were never ordered to change their unlawful cookie banners. Instead, the case was closed with a questionable “settlement” that was not foreseen under Belgian law. [Under the terms of the settlement](https://www.gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit.be/publications/beslissing-ten-gronde-nr.-154-2022.pdf), Mediahuis agreed to pay €10,000 – but was never ordered to bring its cookie banners into compliance with EU data protection law.So the violations continued. The Belgian DPA [didn’t even bother to explain](https://gdprhub.eu/index.php?title=APD/GBA_(Belgium)_-_151/2022) why the cases were settled rather than followed by a formal order to comply.

**Belgian DPA also does a U-turn on absurd rejections.** In a previous series of complaints by _noyb_, the Belgian DPA dismissed complaints on the basis of strange theories about allegedly “forced” complainants. In fact, even when complainants explicitly gave oral testimony that they wished to be represented by _noyb_, the Belgian DPA argued that _noyb_ can't validly represent affiliated people in “model cases”. In this latest case, the Belgian DPA also seems to have done a U-turn on this narrative, claiming that in the present case, the _noyb_-affiliated individuals had in fact validly mandated _noyb._ #change
