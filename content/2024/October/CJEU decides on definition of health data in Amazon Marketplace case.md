Related: [[The CJEU AG considers Amazon OTC-medicines sales by pharmacies as not health data (unless the controller uses the data for diagnosis purposes)]]

ND, which operates a pharmacy under the business name „Lindenapotheke “, has been selling pharmacopoeias that require pharmacies since 2017 via the online platform „Amazon Marketplace “ (hereinafter: Amazon). When ordering these medicines online, ND customers must enter information such as their name, delivery address and the information necessary for the individualization of the medicines.

DR, who also runs a pharmacy, brought an action before the Dessau-Roßlau district court (Germany), requesting that **ND be banned from selling pharmacy-only medicines via Amazon under the threat of regulatory means, as long as it is not ensured that customers have the opportunity in advance to consent to the processing of health data.**

Outcomes:
- Question 1:
	- Q: Do the rules in Chapter VIII of [the GDPR] preclude national rules which – alongside the powers of intervention of the supervisory authorities responsible for monitoring and enforcing the regulation and the options for legal redress for data subjects – empower competitors to bring proceedings for infringements of [that regulation] against the infringer before the civil courts on the basis of the prohibition of unfair commercial practices?
	- A: In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first question is that the provisions of Chapter VIII of the GDPR must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation which, alongside the powers of intervention of the supervisory authorities responsible for monitoring and enforcing that regulation and the remedies available to data subjects, confers on competitors of the person allegedly responsible for an infringement of the laws protecting personal data standing to bring proceedings against that person, by means of an action before the civil courts, for infringements of that regulation and on the basis of the prohibition of unfair commercial practices.
- Question 2:
	- Q: Do the data that the customers of a pharmacist who acts as a seller on an online sales platform enter when ordering pharmacy-only but not prescription-only medicines on the sales platform (data such as the customer’s name, delivery address and information required for individualising the pharmacy-only medicine ordered) constitute data concerning health within the meaning of Article 9(1) of the GDPR and of Article 8(1) of [Directive 95/46]?’
	- Motivation: 
		- In the present case, it is apparent from the documents before the Court that ND’s customers, when ordering pharmacy-only medicinal products online on Amazon, enter information such as their name, the delivery address and details for the individualisation of the medicinal products. That information undoubtedly constitutes ‘personal data’ given that it relates to identified or identifiable natural persons.
		- The data which a customer enters on an online platform when ordering pharmacy-only medicinal products are capable of revealing, by means of an intellectual operation involving collation or deduction, information on the health status of the data subject, within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the GDPR, in so far as that order entails establishing a link between a medicinal product, its therapeutic indications or uses, and a natural person identified or identifiable by factors such as that person’s name or the delivery address.
		- That fundamental prohibition is independent of whether or not the information revealed by the processing operation in question is correct and of whether the data controller is acting with the aim of obtaining information that falls within one of the special categories referred to in Article 8(1) of Directive 95/46 and Article 9(1) of the GDPR. In view of the significant risks to the fundamental freedoms and fundamental rights of data subjects arising from any processing of personal data falling within those categories, the objective of those provisions is to prohibit such processing, irrespective of its stated purpose and the accuracy of the information in question (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 July 2023, _Meta Platforms and Others (General terms of use of a social network)_, C‑252/21, EU:C:2023:537, paragraphs 69 and 70).
		- It follows that, where a user of an online platform communicates personal data when ordering pharmacy-only medicinal products the sale of which does not require a prescription, the processing of those data by the operator of a pharmacy which sells those medicinal products on that online platform must be regarded as processing of data concerning health, within the meaning of Article 8(1) of Directive 95/46 and Article 9(1) of the GDPR, given that the processing of those data is capable of revealing information on the health status of a natural person, irrespective of whether that information concerns that user or any other person for whom the user places the order (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 July 2023, _Meta Platforms and Others (General terms of use of a social network)_, C‑252/21, EU:C:2023:537, paragraph 73).
	- A: In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the second question is that Article 8(1) of Directive 95/46 and Article 9(1) of the GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that, in a situation where the operator of a pharmacy markets pharmacy-only medicinal on an online platform, the information which the customers of that operator enter when ordering the medicinal products online, such as their name, the delivery address and the details required for individualising the medicinal products, constitutes data concerning health, within the meaning of those provisions, even where the sale of those medicinal products does not require a prescription.
