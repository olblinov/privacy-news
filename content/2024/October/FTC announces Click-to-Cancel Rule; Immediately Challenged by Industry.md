The Federal Trade Commission today announced a [final “click-to-cancel” rule](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/federal-register-notices/negative-option-rule-final-rule) that will require sellers to make it as easy for consumers to cancel their enrollment as it was to sign up. Most of the final rule’s provisions will go into effect 180 days after it is published in the Federal Register.

“Too often, businesses make people jump through endless hoops just to cancel a subscription,” said Commission Chair Lina M. Khan. “The FTC’s rule will end these tricks and traps, saving Americans time and money. Nobody should be stuck paying for a service they no longer want.”

The Commission’s updated rule will apply to almost all negative option programs in any media. The rule also will prohibit sellers from misrepresenting any material facts while using negative option marketing; require sellers to provide important information before obtaining consumers’ billing information and charging them; and require sellers to get consumers’ informed consent to the negative option features before charging them.

The final rule will provide a consistent legal framework by prohibiting sellers from:
- misrepresenting any material fact made while marketing goods or services with a negative option feature;
- failing to clearly and conspicuously disclose material terms prior to obtaining a consumer’s billing information in connection with a negative option feature;
- failing to obtain a consumer’s express informed consent to the negative option feature before charging the consumer; and
- failing to provide a simple mechanism to cancel the negative option feature and immediately halt charges.

Three industry groups, the NCTA, the Electronic Security Association (ESA), and the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), are suing to prevent the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) from enforcing its new “Click to Cancel” rule that requires companies to make it easy to cancel subscriptions. Their complaint (included below) alleges the rule is “arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion,” as reported previously by Reuters.
