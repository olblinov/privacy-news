EPIC [called](https://epic.org/documents/in-re-openai/) on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate OpenAI for failing to meet established public policy standards for responsible AI use and development, offering products with unsafe security, privacy, and business practices, perpetuating unfair and deceptive practices in their product development and release, and causing significant consumer harm.

The complaint builds on the FTC’s previously launched investigations into OpenAI’s product development, use, and business practices by calling attention to OpenAI’s third-party API integrations and partnerships and how these exacerbate existing privacy, data protection, and human rights concerns. Further, OpenAI products are now being integrated into high-risk industries like real estate and financial services where the consequences of incorrect or biased technology processing can be devastating for consumers.
