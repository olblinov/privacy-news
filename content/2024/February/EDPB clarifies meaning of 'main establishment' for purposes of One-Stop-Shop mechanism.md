The EDPB considers that a controller’s “place of central administration” in the EU can be considered as a main establishment under Art. 4(16)(a) GDPR only if it takes the decisions on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data and if it has the power to have such decisions implemented. The EDPB further explains that the One-Stop-Shop mechanism can only apply if there is evidence that one of the establishments of the controller in the Union takes decisions on the purposes and means for the relevant processing operations and has the power to have these decisions implemented. This means that, when the decisions on the purposes and means of the processing are taken outside of the EU, there should be no main establishment of the controller in the Union, and therefore the One-Stop-Shop should not apply.
