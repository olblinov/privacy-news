DoorDash sold its California customers’ personal information without providing notice or an opportunity to opt out of that sale in violation of both the CCPA and CalOPPA. The sale occurred in connection with DoorDash’s participation in a marketing cooperative, where businesses contribute the personal information of their customers in exchange for the opportunity to advertise their products to each other’s customers. Interestingly, the violation was identified due to one user who had received mailed advertisements at her home that were addressed to an alias that she had used solely with DoorDash when ordering its food delivery services. #enforcement_pattern
