It may be unfair or deceptive for a company to adopt more permissive data practices—for example, to start sharing consumers’ data with third parties or using that data for AI training—and to only inform consumers of this change through a surreptitious, retroactive amendment to its terms of service or privacy policy. A business that collects user data based on one set of privacy commitments cannot then unilaterally renege on those commitments after collecting users’ data. Especially given that certain features of digital markets can make it more difficult for users to easily switch between services, users may lack recourse once a firm has used attractive privacy commitments to lure them to the product only to turn around and then back out of those commitments.
