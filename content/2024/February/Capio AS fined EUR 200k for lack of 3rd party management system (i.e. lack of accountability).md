The DPA found that 3 data processors were not supervised by the controller despite processing sensitive data. It is thus the opinion of the Data Protection Authority that the private hospital has not been able to secure and demonstrate that personal data is processed for legal and reasonable purposes and in a way, which ensures adequate security for the personal data concerned. Against this background, the Danish Data Protection Agency has decided to report to Capio A / S for not acting in accordance with the data protection principle of accountability.
