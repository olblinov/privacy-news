  - Uber has an app for drivers. The French association of drivers raised a concern with CNIL about principle of transparency & right to data access in the app
  - Issues:
    - *Easy of finding the interface for getting a copy of your data*
      - DPA argued that (1) the user has to be able to find the interface "intuitively"; and (2) 6 steps for downloading data is too much
      - The following was the winning formula: "The steps via the Privacy Center are as follows: Account security and privacy> privacy center > Would you like a copy of your personal data? > log in or “Submit a privacy inquiry without an account” after which the driver will arrive at the form". #dark_pattern 
    - *CSV format*: DPA argues that CSV is a good format but the company needs to provide instructions on how to open it as the strings are not structured when opened in text editor and tabulation may not happen automatically if settings are wrong.
    - *Language*: Exports should be provided in French to French users. Quite similar to Spotify case last year. #dark_pattern 
    - *Specificity of retention periods*: Uber may suffice by stating the criteria for determining the retention periods, but notes that these are also not sufficiently mentioned in the privacy statement. #retention 
    - *International transfers disclosures*: Uber only mentions the various applicable guarantees in general terms and without providing definitive answers. This does not give data subjects the opportunity to determine which guarantees may be relevant to them and what exactly these guarantees entail (by being able to consult the applicable guarantees). However, Article 13(1)(f) GDPR requires an indication as to whether or not an adequacy decision by the Commission exists, or which other appropriate safeguards apply and how to obtain a copy of this are obtained or where they can be consulted. The information requirements set out in this provision are so specific that data subjects must be given access to detailed information about the safeguards used to protect their personal data during transfer.  #transfers 
    - *Data portability*: Needs to be mentioned specifically in the Privacy Notice.
