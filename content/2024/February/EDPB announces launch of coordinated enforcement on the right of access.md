Throughout the year, 31 Data Protection Authorities (DPAs), including 7 German State-level DPAs, across the EEA will take part in this initiative on the implementation of the right of access. Participating DPAs will implement the CEF in a number of ways: (1) organisations will be sent questionnaires to aid fact-finding exercises or to identify if a formal investigation is warranted; (2) commencement of a formal investigation; and/or
(3) follow-up of ongoing formal investigations.
