- **FTC claims TikTok's age gate to be ineffective** (and other COPPA violations) 
  - As of 2020, TikTok had a policy of maintaining accounts of children that it knew were under 13 unless the child made an explicit admission of age and other rigid conditions were met, according to the complaint. TikTok human reviewers allegedly spent an average of only five to seven seconds reviewing each account to make their determination of whether the account belonged to a child. 
  - TikTok built back doors into its platform that allowed children to bypass the age gate aimed at screening children under 13. TikTok allegedly allowed children to create accounts without having to provide their age or obtain parental consent to use TikTok by using credentials from third-party services like Google and Instagram. TikTok classified such accounts as “age unknown” accounts, which grew to millions of accounts, according to the complaint.
  - TikTok collected numerous categories of information and far more data than it needed, such as information about children’s activities on the app and multiple types of persistent identifiers, which it used to build profiles on children, while failing to notify parents about the full extent of its data collection and use practices. For example, TikTok shared this personal data with third parties such as Facebook and AppsFlyer to persuade existing Kids Mode users to use the service more after their use had declined or ceased, through a practice TikTok called “retargeting less active users”.
