- **Swedish DPA fines two pharmacies EUR 3.27M and EUR 710k for misconfigured Meta pixels**: Apoteket and Apohem have used Meta's Meta-pixel analysis tool on their websites to improve their marketing on Facebook and Instagram. The incorrect transfer of personal data has been caused by the companies activating a new sub-function in the Meta pixel. By activating the sub-function, the companies have transferred privacy-sensitive personal data to Meta about a large number of customers. Among other things, the companies have provided information on the purchase of non-prescription drugs for the treatment of, for example, specific health problems, self-tests and treatment of STDs and sex toys. The transfer did not include prescription drugs.
