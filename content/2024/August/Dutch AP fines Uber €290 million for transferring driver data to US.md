- **Dutch AP fines Uber €290 million for transferring driver data to US** (  [decision translation into English](uber_drivers_dutch_ap.md)): The AP has found that Uber has transferred personal data of European taxi drivers to the United States (US) and that Uber has not sufficiently protected the data. The AP launched an investigation into Uber after more than 170 French drivers filed a complaint with the Ligue des droits de l'Homme (LDH), a French human rights advocacy group. The AP regarded several questions relating to Chapter V, including its compatibility with Art. 3 GDPR application, the question of exceptions etc. 
- Among others, the decision deals a heavy blow to the current ambiguity around what incidental transfers mean (in the sense of exceptions) and how far those can be stretched. #change
