# Customer Data
As for customer data, the guidance distinguishes the following matters:

1/ **Contract initiation**. A transfer is only permitted if a review by the seller shows that the seller's own legitimate interests in the transfer are not opposed by any overriding interests of the customer. The legitimate interests of the customer can usually be taken into account by an objection solution. The customers are notified of the data transfer to the buyer with an appropriate period of notice (around 6 weeks) for a possible objection.

2/ **Ongoing contractual relationships**. In case of asset deals, it should be taken into account that customers will continue having e.g. warranty claims towards the original seller. Should a share deal be undertaken, the processing as a debtor and creditor is based on performance of contract.

If an assumption of performance is agreed between the purchaser and the seller, it must be examined whether a transfer of the customer's data from the seller to the purchaser would conflict with the overriding interests of the customer within the meaning of Art. 6 Paragraph 1 Subparagraph 1 Letter f of GDPR. This is generally not the case with regard to the data required for performance, because the customer is primarily interested in performance and this can usually be better guaranteed by the purchaser than by the seller. However, if the interests in not transferring the data outweigh the interests of the customer in individual cases, effective consent from the customer concerned is required.

3/ **Terminated contractual relationship**. If the seller intends to transfer data of former customers without ongoing contracts (legacy data) to the buyer in order to comply with the statutory retention periods, the conclusion of a contract for order processing in accordance with Art. 28 Para. 3 GDPR is required. This data may be transmitted, but may only be used for the purposes of statutory retention periods. The purchaser must separate this data from the data of customers with an ongoing contractual relationship (“two-cabinet solution”).

4/ **Advertising by the purchaser.** To the extent that the purchaser is permitted to process the customer's contact data in accordance with the criteria set out in 2.1 and 2.2, these can generally be used for advertising purposes in accordance with Art. 6, Paragraph 1, Subparagraph 1, Letter f of GDPR to the extent that this would have been permitted by the seller.

5/ **Special categories of customer data**, such as health data, can only be transferred from the seller to the buyer by means of informed and explicit consent in accordance with Art. 9 (2) (a), Art. 7 GDPR.

6/ **Bank details**. The bank details (IBAN) can be transmitted to the purchaser via contract performance, provided these relate to an existing contractual relationship; otherwise, consent is needed. 

# Supplier data
When it comes to business contact details, there are usually no overriding interests that would conflict with the transmission. Suppliers may even generally have an interest in continuing an existing business relationship with a new buyer.

# Employee data
In the context of an "asset deal", the transmission of employee data from the seller to the buyer can generally rely on contract performance.

If a company participates in merger & acquisition activity as seller, matters of personal data transfers arise. In due diligence phase, the DSK confirms that legitimate interest is available with respect to particularly prominent persons. 

However, there may also be special cases in which data transfer from the seller to the buyer will not be permitted or will not be permitted in full, including:
- At the time of mere contract negotiations between sellers and potential buyers - the transmission of employee data is generally not permitted. In individual cases, transmission may only be permitted with the effective consent of the employees.
- Employees who are affected by a transfer of a business must be informed of this in writing. After receiving this information, the affected employees have one month to object to the transfer of their employment relationship to the buyer.

# Misc
## Other obligations
- Seller is responsible for ensuring legal basis for sending data. Purchaser is controller upon receiving data.
- Purchaser must inform the customers in accordance with Art. 14 GDPR within a reasonable period of time, but no later than one month after receiving the data records.
## Transfer of customer db as the only asset
Transmission as part of a sale of customer data as a separate "asset" (sale of customer databases) is generally only possible with the prior consent of the customers concerned. 

Only if micro-enterprises (fewer than 10 employees) or small enterprises (fewer than 50 employees and an annual turnover of no more than EUR 10 million) transfer the data of their customers to a micro-enterprise or small enterprise in the same economic sector due to the termination of their own economic activity , the one-time transmission of only the postal addresses can be implemented by way of an opt-out solution. The affected customers will be informed by the seller about the transfer of their postal addresses and will be informed that they can informally object to the seller within a reasonable period of time (usually 4 - 6 weeks). In the absence of an objection, the transmission of postal addresses as the only asset can exceptionally be based on legitimate interest.
