- **Excessive biometric data use and storage in employment context** (https://www.autoriteprotectiondonnees.be/publications/decision-quant-au-fond-n0-114-2024.pdf): The Belgian Data Protection Authority (DPA) fined a company â‚¬45,000 for GDPR violations involving biometric data collection. The company used employees' fingerprints for time registration without offering an alternative or providing sufficient information on data processing. The DPA found the company failed to obtain valid consent and breached GDPR principles, including purpose limitation, data minimization, and transparency. Key violations were related to Articles 5, 6, 9, and 13 of the GDPR. The company did not properly inform employees or justify its legal basis for processing biometric data.
