In 2023, the Data Protection Commissioner imposed fines totaling 549,410 euros on private bodies in the state of Berlin. The annual report provides information on three key cases:

1/ Fine against a bank for lack of transparency: A bank in Berlin was fined 300,000 euros for failing to comply with its transparency obligations in connection with an **automated individual decision**. The company had refused to provide a customer with comprehensible information about the reasons for the automated rejection of a credit card application.

2/ Fine for collecting particularly sensitive data: A company in the cultural sector was fined 215,000 euros. It had improperly **documented information about the health of employees** and their interest in establishing a works council. The information was intended to be used to prepare dismissals of employees who were on probation.

3/ Fine for covert **video surveillance in the workplace**: In another case, a company had monitored three interns at their workplace using video cameras hidden in electrical sockets without the people concerned knowing about it. The company was fined 4,000 euros because the video surveillance was unnecessary and disproportionate.

At the European level, the BlnBDI played a key role in a fine decision by the Irish data protection authority against the company TikTok Technology Limited (TikTok) last year. The company was fined 345 million euros for violating the rights of minors. Among other things, TikTok had made content from underage users available to the public by default and had not provided sufficient information about this. Together with other German data protection authorities, the BlnBDI managed to get the Irish data protection authority to extend its decision to include a further violation in the European Data Protection Board: so-called **dark patterns** - misleading designs in the app - prevented underage users from making data protection-friendly settings.
