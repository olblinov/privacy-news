Between August and December 2023, BIT designed, built, and tested an online experiment with 5,019 UK adults (18+). 
# Takeaways

1/ Most people accept and use cookies. Even in the experiment treatment group where the default was to decline cookies, 58% people decided to accept (80% was the highest acceptance rate across all the tests). 

2/ Not many people decline cookies. Only 39% declined cookies where that was the default setting was to decline cookies (17% was the lowest rejection rate across all the tests). 

3/ Many people (42%) may want to customise their cookie settings. Current cookie setting management systems make this difficult. With better design, we can help people achieve their privacy goals. 

4/ The design features of cookie settings appear to affect the choices people make.
