- Background: 
	- The savings bank is a communal institution governed by public law, whose tasks include the settlement of banking and credit transactions. On 15 November 2019, it notified the HBDI, in accordance with Article 33 of the GDPR, of a personal data breach consisting of the fact that one of its employees had, on several occasions, unlawfully accessed personal data of TR, one of its customers. The savings bank failed to notify TR (the claimant) of the breach of his personal data.
	- Following the complaint lodged by TR, the HBDI heard the savings bank in writing and orally on the criticisms made against it. During the hearing, the savings bank stated that it had refrained from making a communication under Article 34 of the GDPR because its data protection officer had taken the view that there was no high risk to TR’s rights and freedoms. Disciplinary measures had been taken against the employee concerned and she had confirmed in writing that she had neither copied nor retained the personal data, that she had not transferred them to third parties and that she would not do so in the future. Furthermore, since the HBDI criticised the excessively short period during which access logs were retained, the savings bank informed it that that question would be reviewed.
	- By decision of 3 September 2020, the HBDI informed TR that the savings bank had not infringed Article 34 of the GDPR, since the savings bank’s assessment that the personal data breach committed was unlikely to result in a high risk to his rights and freedoms, within the meaning of that article, was not manifestly incorrect.
	- TR lodged an action against that decision before the Verwaltungsgericht Wiesbaden (Administrative Court, Wiesbaden, Germany), the referring court, asking it to order the HBDI to take action against the savings bank.
- Judgement:
	- GDPR must be interpreted as meaning that when a breach of personal data has been established, the supervisory authority is not required to exercise a corrective power, in particular the power to impose an administrative fine.
