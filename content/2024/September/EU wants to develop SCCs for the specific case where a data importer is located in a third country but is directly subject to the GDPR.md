- **EU wants to develop SCCs for the specific case where a data importer is located in a third country but is directly subject to the GDPR** (https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14404-Standard-contractual-clauses-for-the-transfer-of-data-to-third-country-controllers-and-processors-subject-to-the-GDPR_en): Standard contractual clauses are model data protection clauses EU data exporters can incorporate into their contracts to transfer personal data to data importers in third countries in line with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). These clauses are for the specific case where a data importer is located in a third country but is directly subject to the GDPR. They complement the existing clauses, for data transfers to third country importers not subject to the GDPR.
