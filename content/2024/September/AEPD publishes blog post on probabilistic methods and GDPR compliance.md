On September 2, 2024, the Spanish data protection authority (AEPD) published a blog post on probabilistic methods and GDPR compliance.
### General principles

The AEPD outlined that, following the principle of accuracy under Article 5(1)(d) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), personal data should be accurate at all stages of the processing, including both the reliability of sources of personal data and the accuracy of inferences or outputs.

Furthermore, the AEPD highlighted that to pass the necessity test, data processing should be effective and less intrusive than other options for achieving the same goal, as explained in the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) Toolkit 'Assessing the necessity of measures that limit the fundamental right to the protection of personal data.'

The AEPD concluded that the probabilistic method limitations in terms of performance (e.g., false negatives, false positives, and prediction errors) may affect both accuracy and effectiveness aspects.

### Example: age verification

The AEPD outlined two methods based on:

- confirming the age attribute of a natural person from a trusted or authoritative source, such as an identity card; or
- predicting this age attribute from inherent features or behaviors of a natural person, such as the face or voice.

The AEPD explained, among other things, that:

- despite the advantage of not needing an identity document, the second method may imply an infringement of the GDPR due to its lack of accuracy and effectiveness;
- regarding reliance of solutions to protect children from harm exclusively on facial age estimation, a case-by-case analysis should always be necessary but likely would not be possible, but partial reliance could be;
- controllers should be careful when considering error thresholds for probabilistic methods, for example, an error rate of 0.01% could mean an error in 45,000 people, of which a significant number of children may be classified as adults;
- accurate and effective verification methods should be used to make age-eligibility decisions, at least in the first interaction with the user, such as account creation; and
- it should be avoided to involve excessive data and subjecting individuals to more operations than is strictly necessary. In most cases, the problem should be solved by offering alternative or complementary solutions.
