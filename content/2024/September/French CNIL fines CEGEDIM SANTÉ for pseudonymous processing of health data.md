- **French CNIL fines CEGEDIM SANTÉ for pseudonymous processing of health data** (https://www.cnil.fr/en/health-data-cegedim-sante-fined-eu800000):
  - CEGEDIM SANTÉ publishes and sells management software for general practitioners working in surgery and health centers. Some 25,000 medical practices and 500 health centers use this software. This software enables doctors to manage their diaries, patient files and prescriptions. As part of its business, the company offers a panel of doctors using one of these software packages the opportunity to join an "observatory". Data collected are then used by CEGEDIM SANTÉ's customers, in particular for research purposes.
  - The restricted committee noted that CEGEDIM SANTÉ collected a large amount of data on the individuals concerned, such as year of birth, gender, socio-professional category, allergies, medical history, height, weight, diagnosis, medical prescriptions, sick leaves and analysis results. The data were linked to a unique identifier for each patient of the same doctor, **making it possible to combine data transmitted successively by the same doctor concerning the same patient, and thus to reconstruct their healthcare pathway**. In view of thisinformation, the restricted committee considered that it was possible to isolate an individual within the company's database, and that the company possessed a great deal of particularly detailed information concerning that individual, leading to a risk of re-identification.  #personal_data #change #anonymization
  - It noted that consultation of the data from this teleservice by a doctor who was a member of the "observatory" automatically led to the data being downloaded into the patient's computerized file, enabling the company to collect it at the same time. The restricted committee considered that, by not providing for the possibility of data simply being consulted by doctors without leading to an automatic collection, the company had not processed the data lawfully.
