This inquiry was launched in April 2019, after Meta Platforms Ireland Limited (MPIL) notified the DPC that it had inadvertently stored certain passwords of social media users in ‘plaintext’ on its internal systems (i.e. without cryptographic protection or encryption).

Interestingly, the fine is not triggered by a data breach, but just as a consequence of low security practices.
