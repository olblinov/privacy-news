- **CJEU on whether partners have a right to learn contact details of other partners in a partnership** (https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?mode=req&pageIndex=1&docid=290003&part=1&doclang=EN&text=&dir=&occ=first&cid=2040209):
  -   It is apparent from the orders for reference that HTB and Ökorenta are investment companies which each hold shares indirectly through a trust company in investment funds.  The applicants in the main proceedings request the defendants in the main proceedings, which are trust companies, to disclose the names and addresses of all their partners with indirect shareholdings in the investment funds concerned, through trust companies. The defendants in the main proceedings object to such a disclosure, taking the view that the data requested are intended to serve the economic interests of the applicants in the main proceedings, consisting in advertising their own investment products, causing concern among investors, or purchasing their shares at a price below their value and making a profit by reselling them.
  -   In accordance with the case-law of the Bundesgerichtshof (Federal Court of Justice), the abuse of rights is, in any event, ruled out where an investor seeks contact with other investors in order to discuss matters concerning the partnership with them and, where appropriate, to organise a commonality of interests between investors. 
  -   Questions:
      -    In the case of a [partnership offering shares for public subscription], a limited partner with negligible liability has a “legitimate interest” in obtaining information relating to all partners with shares held indirectly through a trustee, together with their contact details and the number of their shares in such a partnership, and a contractual obligation to that effect must be inferred from the partnership agreement?
      -    Does the intention to make contact for the purpose of becoming better acquainted, exchanging views or negotiating the purchase of shares in the partnership suffice in order not to exceed the limits to prevent abuse of rights inherent in such an unrestricted right?
 -    CJEU's judgement: 
      -  [46-47] ... it should be noted that the essential feature of acquiring an indirect shareholding, through a trust company, in an investment fund offering shares for public subscription is precisely the anonymity of the partners, including in relations between the partners themselves. ... Accordingly ... the processing of confidential data, consisting in disclosing information concerning partners with indirect shareholdings through a trust company in an investment fund offering shares for public subscription, cannot be regarded as being ‘necessary for the performance of a contract’.
      -  [50] a wide range of interests is, in principle, capable of being regarded as legitimate (judgment of 7 December 2023, SCHUFA Holding (Discharge from remaining debts), C‑26/22 and C‑64/22, EU:C:2023:958, paragraph 76).
      -  [64]  it is necessary to attach particular significance to the fact that it is likely, with regard, in particular, to the contractual provisions referred to in paragraph 45 of this judgment, that the indirect partners of such an investment fund could not reasonably expect, at the time when their personal data are collected, that those personal data are disclosed to third parties, in the present case, to other indirect partners of that investment fund.
