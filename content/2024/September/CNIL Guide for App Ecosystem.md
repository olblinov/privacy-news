CNIL published a guide focused on apps. It deals with stakeholders in the ecosystem (developers, publishers, app stores, OS providers, SDK providers etc.), GDPR applicability, explains their roles in terms of processing.

Among others, the guide 
- reinforces the obligation to collect consent for app-specific identifiers such as mobile ids;
- contextualises OS permissions in GDPR through concepts such as data minimisation;
- encourages local (on-device) processing by excluding it from GDPR applicability scope.
